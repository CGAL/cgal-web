<h1>CONTRIBUTOR AGREEMENT</h1>

<p>Thank you for your interest in providing one or
more contributions to CGAL, the Computational
Geometry Algorithms Library, which is a collection of components
  contributed independently by various Copyright owners,
  which all together form The CGAL Project.</p>

<p>"We" or "Us" means GeometryFactory, Sarl, a French corporation
  which is a member of the CGAL Project and forwards
the contributions to the respective Copyright owners of the CGAL components.</p>

<p>  We refer to the contributor as <em>You</em>. 
</p>

<p>In order to document the copyright and other
rights granted with Contributions (as defined below), We collect a
Contributor Agreement (“Agreement”) from You which confirms your
agreement to the terms below. Please follow the instructions at the
end of the document to make it effective. This is a legally binding
document, so please read it carefully before agreeing to it. The
Agreement provides for submission of Contributions to more than one
software project managed by Us. 
</p>

<h2>1. Definitions</h2>

<p>	1.1	<em>Contribution</em> shall mean any work of
authorship that is Submitted to Us in which You own the Copyright. If
You do not own the Copyright in the entire work of authorship
Submitted, You should follow the procedure in Section 3(d).</p>

<p>	1.2	<em>Copyright</em> shall mean all rights
protecting works of authorship, including copyright, moral and
neighboring rights, as appropriate, for the full term of their

Affiliates or (b) which You or Your Affiliates have the right to
grant, to the maximum extent possible, whether on the Submission Date
of the relevant Contribution or subsequently acquired, under the
terms of Section 2.1(b), but only to the extent to which the making,

otherwise transferring of the Contribution or the Contribution with a
Work infringes such Patent Claims.</p>

which a Contribution is Submitted to Us.

<h2>   Transfer Options</h2>

entering into the Agreement.</p>

<p>(b)  To the maximum extent permitted by the
relevant law, You grant to Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable license under the Copyrights
covering the Contribution, with the right to sublicense such rights
through multiple tiers of sublicensees, to reproduce, modify,

the Patent Claims, with the right to sublicense these rights to
multiple tiers of sublicensees,  to make, have made, use, offer for
sale, sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution and the

conditioned upon compliance with Section 2.1(d). 
</p>

<p>(d)<!--(Option Five)--> Based on the license rights
granted in Section 2.1(b) and 2.1(c), if We include Your Contribution
in a Work, We may license such Contribution under any license,
including copyleft, permissive, commercial, or proprietary licenses,
but as a condition of the exercise of this right in Section 2.1(d),
We agree to license the Contribution under the terms of the license
or licenses which We are using on the Submission Date for the Work in
  which the Contribution is included.</p>


<h3>2.2	Moral Rights</h3>

<p>If moral rights apply to the
Contribution,  to the maximum extent permitted by law, You waive and
agree not to assert such moral rights against Us or our successors in
interest, or any of our licensees, either direct or indirect.</p>

<h3>2.3 	Our Rights</h3>

<p>You acknowledge that We are not
obligated to use your Contribution as part of the Work distributed by
Us and may make the decision to include any Contribution as it
  believes is appropriate.</p>

<h2>3. AGREEMENT</h2>

that You or Your Affiliates own the Copyrights and the Patent Claims
covering the Contribution which are required to grant the rights
under Section 2. 
</p>
<p>(c) The grant of rights under Section 2
does not violate any grant of rights which You or Your Affiliates
have made to third parties.</p>


<h2>4. DISCLAIMER</h2>

<p>EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES IN ARTICLE 3,
THE CONTRIBUTION IS PROVIDED <em>AS IS</em>. MORE PARTICULARLY, ALL
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
AND NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY YOU TO US. TO THE
EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH WARRANTIES CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED, SUCH WARRANTY
IS LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE MINIMUM PERIOD PERMITTED BY LAW.  
</p>

<h2>5. CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE WAIVER</h2>

IN NO EVENT WILL YOU BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF
ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF DATA, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT
REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT
  (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.</p>

<h2>6. MISCELLANEOUS</h2>

<p>6.1 Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of France
excluding its conflicts of law provisions. Under certain
circumstances, the governing law in this section might be superseded
by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods (<em>UN Convention</em>) and the parties intend to avoid
the application of the UN Convention to this Agreement and, thus,
exclude the application of the UN Convention in its entirety to this
  Agreement.</p>

<p>6.2  Miscellaneous Provisions. This Agreement sets
out the entire agreement between You and Us for your Contributions to
Us and overrides all other agreements or understandings. Either party
may assign the rights and obligations under the Agreement to any
third party if the third party agrees, as a condition of the
assignment,  in writing to abide by the rights and obligations in the
Agreement. The failure of either party to require performance by the
other party of any provision of this Agreement in one situation shall
not affect the right of a party to require such performance at any
time in the future and a waiver of performance under a provision in
one situation shall not be considered a waiver of the performance of
the provision in the future or a waiver of the provision in its
entirety. If any provision of this Agreement is found void and
unenforceable, such provision will be replaced to the extent possible
with a provision that comes closest to the meaning of the original
provision and which is enforceable. The terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement shall apply notwithstanding any failure of
essential purpose of this Agreement or any limited remedy to the
  maximum extent possible under law.</p>
