<P>
Traditionally, the scope of computational geometry research has been
limited to manipulation of geometric elements in the Euclidean space
R<sup>d</sup>.
</P>

<P>
This one day event will bring together researchers from various
application areas working on simulations, having in common that the
domains of their simulation are often periodic spaces. The periodicity
avoids special treatment at the domain boundaries.  Additionally,
we will present the most recent advances in CGAL concerning
3D Delaunay triangulations and Voronoi diagrams in periodic spaces.
The workshop is a <em>prospective</em> workshop, as the periodic triangulations 
are work in progress, and hence not yet integrated in the CGAL distribution.
However, they are already robust and fast enough to be exposed and tested by
potential real world users.
</P>

<p>The workshop has two main goals: To share experiences and to identify
common algorithmic needs as far as the the geometric foundation is
concerned, that is by abstracting from the fact that the domain models
the universe, a composite material in a nuclear reactor, or huge
molecules floating in water.

<p><em><b>CGAL 3D Triangulations in Periodic Spaces</b></em><br>
<i>Manuel Caroli</i> and Monique Teillaud, INRIA<br>
<a href="talk_manuel_caroli.pdf">slides</a>
<br><br>

In this talk we present the implementation of periodic 3D Delaunay
triangulations in CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library.</p>
<p>
Naively extending the Delaunay triangulation algorithm to periodic
triangulations would require to compute a triangulation of infinitely
many points. However, exploiting the periodicity it is possible to
compute a triangulation using only a finite number of periodic copies
of each input point. We describe how we handle this issue using even
only one periodic copy of each point, whenever this is possible. We
formulate a condition on the point set that is efficiently verified by
our implementation. Additionally we provide some heuristics for
speed-up.</p>

<p>
To the best of our knowledge there is no implementation available using
this approach. Unlike other available implementations we came to know
about we guarantee to correctly/exactly compute the periodic Delaunay
triangulation for a point set without having the need of any special
boundary treatment.</p>

<p>
For topological reasons the interface requires some changes, however we
maintain a maximum part of the interface of the CGAL 3D Triangulation
package.</p>

<p><em><b>Periodicity and the Design of Bone Scaffolds</b></em><br> 
<i>Maarten Moesen</i>, Jan Schrooten, and Stepan V. Lomov, Department of Metallurgy and Materials Engineering (MTM), K.U. Leuven <br><br>

Bone scaffolds are porous materials used for replacing damaged bone in
therapies for healing bone defects up to a few centimeters. To enhance
bone regeneration, bone scaffolds should provide various biological,
transport, and mechanical functions. The general aim of this work is
to support these functions by controlling biomechanically related
material properties throughout a bone scaffold via an appropriate
design of its structure and geometry.
</p>

<p>
One design strategy involves constructing a regular bone scaffold
based on a parametric unit cell. Because such a unit cell provides a
complete geometrical description of the bone scaffold while being
relatively small, it allows cost-effective determination of local and
apparent material properties using numerical simulations, on the
condition that appropriate boundary conditions are applied. In this
talk, the suitability of periodic boundary conditions will be
discussed, together with the practical requirements that they impose
on mesh generation. In addition, open questions will be raised
concerning the characterization of topological properties based on
periodic unit cells.

<p><em><b>Multi-scale mechanics of granular materials</b></em><br> 
<i>O. Duran</i>, N.P. Kruyt, K. Bertoldi and S. Luding, 
Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Twente  <br><br>

Granular materials consist of nearly-rigid, interacting particles and
voids. The objective of multi-scale mechanics of granular materials is
to study the relation between particle properties at the micro-scale
and continuum-mechanical properties at the macro-scale, such as the
average stress and strain tensors.</p>

<p>
To obtain detailed information at the micro-scale, Discrete Element
Method simulations are frequently used, in which the motion of a large
set of particles is determined by numerically integrating the
equations of motion. To suppress wall effects and to maintain
spatially homogeneous deformation, such simulations are often
performed in three-dimensional periodic space.</p>

<p>
To study characteristics and statistics of the deformation at the
micro-scale, Delaunay tessellations are used. In addition, adaptive
multi-phase computational fluid dynamics methods, with hierarchical
data-structures, are being developed that depend on fast Delaunay
tessellations.

<p><em><b>Periodic Computer Representations of the Cosmic Structure</b></em><br>
<i>Rien van de Weijgaert</i>, Kapteyn Institute, University of Groningen 
<br><a href="http://www.astro.rug.nl/~weygaert/tim1publication/cgal/cgal.universe.simulate.ppt">slides</a>(ppt, 80 Mb)<br><br>

    Cosmology is the study of the structure and evolution of the Universe 
    and its contents. One of the most important issues is the formation 
    of structure and the emergence of cosmic objects out of the almost 
    featureless pristine Universe some 13.6 Gyrs ago. All evidence points 
    towards a gravitational amplification of initial Gaussian density and 
    velocity ripples with tiny amplitudes. An important consideration 
    is that of the cosmological principle: there are no preferred or 
    central positions in the Universe, each sizeable volume of the  
    Universe is more or less (statistically) representative. </p>

<p>    When simulating the evolution of cosmic structure we therefore need 
    to guarantee that the simulation volume is representative. This is 
    most straightforwardly accomplished by specifying volumes with 
    periodic boundary conditions. Effectively it means that the simulation 
    ignores the influence of primordial density and velocity fluctuations 
    with wavenumbers smaller than the fundamental wavelength of the simulation 
    box. </p>

<p>    One of the main instruments for studying the formation of structure
    are N-body simulations, in which the cosmic mass distribution is 
    reflected in a representative spatial distribution of discrete particles.  
    I will describe how Delaunay and Voronoi tessellations are powerful 
    instruments for analyzing and following the multiscale and strongly 
    patterned nature of spatial structure on Megaparsec scales.

<p><em><b>Radiative Transfer Using Unstructured Grids</b></em><br> 
Cornelis Dullemond, Max-Planck-Institut for Astronomy, Heidelberg<br>
<a href="talk_cornelis_dullemond.ppt">slides</a> <br><br>

Arguably, two of the most fundamental problems in astrophysics are the
motion and flow of gas ("hydrodynamics") and the propagation of
radiation through these structures of gas ("radiative transfer").
Since in problems of cosmology, star formation, galaxy formation etc,
the flows of interstellar gas are very chaotic and clumpy, theoretical
modelers have since long used "adaptive mesh refinement" (AMR)
techniques to assure sufficient resolution at places where this is
necessary while reducing the spatial resolution there where little gas
is present. </p>

<p>However, it has become clear that traditional hierarchical
AMR techniques have many problems, and slowly but surely the
astrophysical community is getting used to the idea of using fully
unstructured grids to model complex astrophysical problems. Since
space is effectively infinite, to limit the computational domain to
finite size for hydrodynamic calculations, periodic boundary
conditions are often invoked. While they are not necessarily
realistic, they appear to be much less troubling than fixed wall or
outflow boundary conditions. To perform the corresponding radiative
transfer for such simulations requires that also the radiative
transfer model can make use of such boundary conditions. In particular
for cosmological simulations this is of particular use.</p>

<p> I will mainly
present how radiative transfer is done or will be done on Delaunay
and/or Voronoi grids, and I will then briefly outline the pros and
cons of using periodic boundary conditions for this problem.
