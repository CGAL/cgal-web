<p><em><b>Modeling of Cell Shape In Cellular Networks</b></em><br>
Thomas DONY, Orange Labs, FT/NSM/RD/RESA/NET/OPS Belfort<br><br>

Cellular networks comprise a certain amount of transmitters whose
purpose is to provide a radio access in a given area. Each transmitter
is supposed to serve a certain portion of the area. Also they have to
communicate each other to exchange users as they move through the
network. In this talk we will describe how we can model cell shapes
and neighbor relationships with Voronoï diagrams and Delaunay
triangulations.

Johannes Otepka, Christian Doppler Laboratory “Spatial Data from Laser Scanning and Remote Sensing”, Vienna University of Technology. <br><br>


Using Airborne Laser Scanning precise Digital Terrain Models (DTM) can
be derived which form the basis of high quality hydraulic models. Due
to restriction and limitation of Computational Fluid Dynamic
Simulations DTM data have to be appropriately reduced and adapted to
achieve (meaningful) results. In the DTM reduction step the CGAL
implementation of the Constrained Delaunay Triangulation is used.

<p><em><b>Using CGAL for robust planar geometry processing in Agilent ADS</b></em><br> 
Michiel Dewilde, Agilent<br><br>

The Agilent Advanced Design System contains the method-of-moments solver Momentum for layered planar (2.5D) electromagnetic problems. Layouts that are just fine for fabrication often contain small features that are undesirable for the EM solver as they complicate adequate mesh generation. The layout clean-up process that is being performed builds on CGAL for robust geometrical processing. We will present our interaction with CGAL's Arrangement_2 class and the acceleration offered by CGAL's filtered predicate mechanism.

to difficult computer vision problems: the automatic 3D reconstruction of a static 
scene from photographs, and the spatio-temporal reconstruction of a moving scene from 
multiple video sequences.

Jelle Feringa, EZCT Architecture & Design Research<br><br>


EZCT has worked together in close collaboration with Marc Schoenauer to evolve  an architectural envelope, based on specific daylight conditions.
Rather than applying a binary matrix for its genotype, a Voronoï diagram was applied, resulting in a more powerful representation.
This talk will discuss both the potential of computational geometry for architecture and will discuss the current state as well as the future of the CGAL python bindings.

<p><B>Meet the Developers - Get Demos - Let's Hack </B><br><br>

In this session we have a couple of booths where developers give demos
of their CGAL packages, some of which being under development and
scheduled for the next release of the library.  The selected demos
cover large areas of the library and give you the opportunity to ask
questions, have a closer look at code, and maybe do some rapid
prototyping together.

<p><em><b>Arrangements on Surfaces</b></em><br>
Ophir Setter and Efi Fogel, Tel-Aviv University<br><br>

In the illustration you can see an arrangement on a sphere induced by geodesic arcs. It represents the map
of the world. The town of Nancy is represented as an isolated vertex
in the arrangement, and is colored red, while all other vertices are
colored green. Coordinates are taken from Google Earth. This
arrangement, like any other, is ready for point location, overlay
computation, Boolean set operations, etc.

<p><em><b>Triangulations in Periodic Spaces</b></em><br>
Manuel Caroli and Monique Teillaud, INRIA<br><br>

The goal of our work is to extend the CGAL 3D triangulation package to compute triangulations in 3-dimensional spaces other than R3.
For example, in simulation one is typically interested in having no boundaries. In this case, it makes sense to compute triangulations in
the periodic space T3.

We present the latest features of the Surface mesh generator which is already a package in CGAL 3.3,
as well as a first version of a tetrahedral mesh generator, which allows to simultaneously generate
iso surface meshes in a grey level image and the volume between these surfaces.

<A HREF="http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~emeliyan/">Pavel Emeliyanenko</A> and <A HREF="http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~mkerber/">Michael Kerber</A>, MPI<br><br>

We present a online accessible web page that visualizes planar arrangements
induced by arbitrary algebraic curves. Our tool is exact in the sense that it
computes the exact topology of the arrangement, and the plot is always
correct for the chosen resolution.
The website also provides zooming functions, partial selection of curve
segments, and export into a png-file.<br><br>

<p><em><b>3D Boolean Operations</b></em><br>
Peter Hachenberger, TU Eindhoven<br><br>

The definition of Nef polyhedra is the most general polyhedron
definition there is. In contrast to other polyhedron definitions, Nef
polyhedra are closed under Boolean and topological
operations. Consequently, Nef polyhedra can model non-manifold
situations, open and closed boundaries, and lower dimensional
features. We provide an exact and efficient implementation of 3D Nef
polyhedra together with Boolean and topological operations. They have
a great number of application, like computer-aided design, the
Minkowski sum, and the visual hull.</p>

<p><em><b>Voronoi Diagrams of Ellipses</b></em><br>
George Tzoumas, University of Athens<br><br>

Following the generic programming paradigm, we applied the Apollonius
diagram algorithm in order to compute the Voronoi diagram of ellipses
by supplying the appropriate predicates. This requires adequate
algebraic support for dealing with algebraic numbers of degree 184 or
computing resultants of trivariate systems.

<p><em><b>Variational Meshing</b></em><br>
Jane Tournois and Pierre Alliez, INRIA<br><br>
 
We address the problem of generating high quality simplicial meshes through
optimization techniques.<br>
In 2D, our algorithm interleaves Delaunay refinement and mesh optimization
using Lloyd's iteration. Our experiments improve over other methods by
producing higher quality meshes with fewer Steiner points.<br>
In 3D, we are currently extending the optimal Delaunay triangulations technique
[Chen04] so as to handle domains bounded by piecewise smooth surfaces.

<p><em><b>The Python Language Binding and Visualization with VPython </b></em><br>
Christodoulos Fragoudakis, University of Athens <br><br>
 
The <a href="http://cgal-python.gforge.inria.fr/">CGAL-Python bindings</a> provide robust geometric classes in
Python, which is the language of choice when low level details about
algorithm implementations have to be abstracted..  Our <a href="http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~compgeom/pycgalvisual">
py.CGAL.visual</a> initiative extends the existing Python-CGAL
bindings and adds visualization. Our main contributions are new
bindings for polygons and kd-trees as well as a custom visualization library
on top of <A href="http://vpython.org">VPython</a>.
