<p>Version 2.1 differs from version 2.0 in the platforms that are supported and
in functionality.</p>

<p>
Supported platforms:

<UL>
   <LI> the newest gnu compiler (2.95.2) on Sun, SGI, Linux and Windows.
   <LI> the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler, version 6.
   <LI> the mips CC compiler version 7.3 under Irix.
</UL>

Support for the old g++ compiler (2.8) and for mips CC 7.2 has been dropped.

<BR><BR>
The following functionality has been added:

<UL>
<LI> Alpha shapes and weighted alpha shapes in 2D. Alpha shapes are a
     generalization of the convex hull of a point set.
<LI> Arrangements in 2D. Arrangements are related to and based on planar maps.
     The major difference between the two is that curves are allowed to
     intersect in the case of arrangements.
<LI> Extensions to triangulations in 2D.  Constrained triangulations are now
     dynamic: they support insertions of new constraint as well as removal of
     existing constraints.  There are also constrained Delaunay triangulations.
<LI> Triangulations in 3D were added, both Delaunay triangulations and regular
     triangulations.
<LI> Min_quadrilateral optimisations have been added.  These are algorithms to
     compute the minimum enclosing rectangle/parallelogram (arbitrary
     orientation) and the minimum enclosing strip of a convex point set.
<LI> 2d Point_set is a package for 2d range search operations, Delaunay
     triangulation, nearest neighbor queries. This package works only if
     LEDA
     is installed.
<LI> Support for GeoWin visualization library. This also depends on
     LEDA.
<LI> Support for using the
     CLN number type
     together with CGAL.
</LI>
</UL>
