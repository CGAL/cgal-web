<p>CGAL 2.2 differs from <a href="../../../../2000/01/01/cgal-21">CGAL 2.1</a> in the platforms that are supported and
in functionality:</p>

## Changelog

### Supported platforms
  -  The KAI compiler (4.0) on Solaris 5.8
  -  Borland C++ (5.5)

### General
  - There is a new, non-reference-counted kernel, `Simple_cartesian`. Because
    reference counting is not used, and thus coordinates are stored within a
    class, debugging is easier using this kernel.  This kernel can also be
    faster in some cases than the reference-counted `Cartesian kernel`.
  - A generator for ``random'' simple polygons is now available.
  - In directory demo/Robustness, programs that demonstrate typical robustness
    problems in geometric computing are presented along with the solutions to
    these problems that CGAL provides.
  - The binary operations on polygons (union, intersection ...) have been
    removed. Those operations were not documented in the previous release
    (2.1). Arrangements can often be used as a substitute.

### New optimisation algorithms
  - `Min_annulus_d`: Algorithm for computing the smallest enclosing
    annulus of points in arbitrary dimension
  - `Polytope_distance_d`: Algorithm for computing the (squared)
    distance between two convex polytopes in arbitrary dimension
  - `Width_3`: Algorithm for computing the (squared) width of points
    sets in three dimensions

### 2D Triangulations
  - There are now two triangulation data structures available in CGAL.
    The new one uses a list to store the faces and allows one to
    represent two-dimensional triangulations embedded in three spaces
    as well as planar triangulations.
  - The triangulation hierarchy which allows fast location query
    is now available.

### 3D Triangulations
  -  Removal as well as insertions of vertices for 3D Delaunay triangulations is now possible.

### Planar Maps
  -  Inifinite objects can now be included in planar maps.
