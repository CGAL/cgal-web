<p>CGAL 2.4 differs from <a href="../../../../2001/10/01/cgal-23">CGAL 2.3</a> in the platforms that are supported and
in functionality.  There have also been a number of bug fixes for this release.</p>

## Changelog

### Supported platforms
  -  Microsoft Visual C++, version 7.
  -  SunPro 5.3 (with patch 111685-05) on Solaris
  -  g++ 3.1 on Linux and Solaris

### General
  - Bugs in the following packages have been fixed: 3D Convex hull, 2D Polygon partition, simple polygon generator.
  - Tttempts have been made to assure compatability with the upcoming LEDA release that introduces
    the leda namespace.

### Kernels
  - `Point_d` has been removed from the 2D and 3D kernels. This type is
    now available from the d-dimensional kernel only.

### 2D Polygon Partitioning
  - Traits requirements for optimal partitioning have been changed slightly.

### 2D Sweep line (new package)
  - A new package that implements a sweep-line algorithm to compute
    arrangements of curves for different families of curves, which are
    not necessarily line segments  (e.g., it also works for circular arcs).
    The resulting output can be the list of vertex points, the resulting
    subcurves or a planar map.

### Planar Maps and Arrangements
  -  New quicker insertion functions of `Planar_map_2` for cases where more
     precomputed information is available regarding the position of
     the inserted curve in the map.
  -  New query function for planar maps that determines whether a given
     point is within a given face of the planar map.
  -  New iterator over edges of planar maps in addition to the existing
     iterator over halfedges.
  -  New copy constructor and assignment operator for arrangements.

### Polyhedral Surface
  - new design introduced with release 2.3 now supported by VC7 compiler.
  - Extended functionality of Polyhedron_incremental_builder:
    absolute indexing allows one to add new surfaces to existing ones.

### 2D Triangulation
  - There is a new triangulation data structure replacing the two
    previous ones. This new data structure is coherent with the 3d
    triangulation data structure and offer the advantages of both
    previous ones. Backward compatibility is ensured and this change
    is transparent for the user of triangulation classes.
  - Constrained and Delaunay constrained triangulations are now able
    to handle intersecting input constraints.
    The behavior of constrained triangulations with repect to
    intersection of input constraints can be customized using
    an intersection tag.
  - A new class Constrained_triangulation_plus offers a constrained
    hierarchy on top of a constrained triangulations. This additionnal
    data structure describes the subdivision of the original constraints
    into edges of the triangulations.

### 3D Triangulation
  - Running time improved by a better and more compact management of memory allocation.
  -  Various improvements and small functionalities added:
    - Triangulation_3&lt;GT,Tds&gt;::triangle() returns a triangle oriented
      towards the outside of the cell c for facet (c,i)
    - New function `insert(Point, Locate_type, Cell_handle, int, int)` which avoids the location step.
    - New function to get access to cells in conflict in a Delaunay insertion: `find_conflicts()` and `insert_in_hole()`.
    - New function `TDS::delete_cells(begin, end)`.
    - New functions `degree(v)`, `reorient()`, `remove_decrease_dimension()`, `remove_from_simplex()`.
  -  Changes of interface:
    -  Vertices and cells are the same for the triangulation data structure and the geometric triangulation.
    -  The triangulation data structure uses `Vertex_handle` (resp `Cell_handle`) instead of `Vertex*` (resp `Cell*`).
    -  `incident_cells()` and `incident_vertices()` are templated by output iterators.
    -  changes in the iterators and circulators interface:
      -  Iterators and circulators are convertible to handles
         automatically, no need to call `->handle()` anymore.
      -  `Vertex_iterator` split into `All_vertices_iterator` and `Finite_vertices_iterator`
         (and similar for cells...).
      -  `TDS::Edge/Facet` iterators now support `operator->`.

### 2D Search structures
  - Additional range search operations taking a predicate functor have been added.

### Planar Maps and Arrangements
  -  Planar maps of infinite curves (the so-called planar map bounding-box).


### Support Library

#### Qt_widget
  - We have added a new class for visualization of 2D CGAL objects.
    It is derived from Trolltech's Qt class QWidget and privdes a
    used to scale and pan.
  - Some demos were developed for the following packages: 2D Alpha shapes,
    2D Convex Hull, Largest empty 2D rectangle, Maximum k-gon,
    Minimum ellipse,  Minimum 2D quadrilateral, 2D polygon partitioning
    2D regular and constrained triangulation.
  - Tutorials are available to help users get used to Qt_widget

#### Timer
  - Fixed Timer class (for user process time) to have no wrap-around
    anymore on Posix-compliant systems.

### Known problems
  - 2D Nef Polyhedra contains a memory leak.  Memory problems are also
    the likely cause of occasional run-time errors on some platforms.
  - The d-dimensional convex hull computation produces run-time errors on
    some platforms because of memory management bugs.
  - The new Halfedge Data Structure design introduced with release 2.3
    does not work on VC6.  See the release notes in the manual for more
    information.
  - The following deficiencies relate to planar maps, planar maps of
    intersecting curves (pmwx), arrangements and sweep line.

#### Plateform specific issues
  - On KCC, Borland and SunPro we guarantee neither compilation nor
    correct execution for all of the packages above.
  - On VC6 and VC7 we guarantee neither compilation nor correct
    execution of the sweep line package.
  - On CC (on Irix 6.5) the trapezoidal decomposition point location
    strategy is problematic when used with planar maps, pmwx, or
    arrangements (mind that this is the default for planar maps).
  - On CC (on Irix 6.5) sweep line with polyline traits does not compile
    (mind that the so-called leda polyline traits does compile).
  - On g++ (on Irix 6.5) the segment-circle (Arr_segment_circle_traits_2)
    traits does not compile for either of the above packages.
