## Changelog

### Supported platforms
  - MS Visual C++, version 7.1.
  - SunPro CC versions 5.4 and 5.5 on Solaris
  - GNU g++ versions 3.2 and 3.3 on Linux, Solaris, Irix, cygwin, and FreeBSD.
  - MipsPRO CC 7.30 and 7.40 with both the n32 and n64 ABIs.

#### The following platforms are no longer supported:
  - MS Visual C++, version 6.
  - GNU g++ 2.95.2 (2.95.3 is still supported)
  - Kai C++ and Borland C++, all versions

### General
  - The CORE library for exact computations is now distributed as part of CGAL as well.
  - `Largest_empty_rectangle_2`: Given a set of points P in the plane, the class
    `Largest_empty_iso_rectangle_2` is a data structure that
    maintains an iso-rectangle with the largest area among all
    iso-rectangles that are inside a given iso-rectangle bounding box,
    and that do not contain any point of the point set P.

### Kernels
  - 3 typedefs have been added to ease the choice of a robust and fast kernel:
    - `Exact_predicates_inexact_constructions_kernel`
    - `Exact_predicates_exact_constructions_kernel`
    - `Exact_predicates_exact_constructions_kernel_with_sqrt`
  - Progress has been made towards the complete adaptability and extensibility of our kernels.
  - New faster `Triangle_3` intersection test routines. `(see Erratum at the bottom)`
  - Added a Kernel concept archetype to check that generic algorithms
      don't use more functionality than they should.
  - A few more miscellaneous functions.

### Interval Skip List (new package)
  - An interval skip list is a data strucure for finding all intervals
    that contain a point, and for stabbing queries, that is for answering
    the question whether a given point is contained in an interval or not.

### 2D Apollonius Graph (new package)
  - Algorithms for computing the Apollonius graph in two dimensions.
    The Apollonius graph is the dual of the Apollonius diagram, also known as the additively weighted Voronoi
    diagram.  The latter can be thought of as the Voronoi diagram of a set
    of circles under the Euclidean metric, and it is a generalization of the
    standard Voronoi diagram for points.  The algorithms provided are
    dynamic.

### dD Min Sphere of Spheres (new package)
  - Algorithms to compute the smallest
    enclosing sphere of a given set of spheres in R<sup>d</sup>.
    The package provides
    an algorithm with maximal expected running time
    `O(2<sup>O(d)</sup> n)` and a
    fast and robust heuristic (for dimension less than 30).

### Spatial Searching (new package)
  - Provides exact and approximate distance browsing in a set of points in `d`-dimensional
    space using implementations of algorithms supporting:
    - both nearest and furthest neighbor searching
    - both exact and approximate searching
    - (approximate) range searching
    - (approximate) `k`-nearest and `k`-furthest neighbor searching
    - (approximate) incremental nearest and incremental furthest neighbor searching
    - query items representing points and spatial objects.

### Kd-tree
  - This package is deprecated, its documentation is removed. It is replaced by the Spatial Searching package.

### 2D Triangulation and 3D Triangulation
  - The classes Triangulation_data_structure_2 (and 3), which implements
    the data structure for 2D triangulation class, now makes use of
    CGAL::Compact_container (see Support Library section below).
  - The triangulation classes use a Rebind mecanism to provide
    the full flexibility on Vertex and Face base classes.
    This means that it is possible for the user to derive its own Face
    of Vertex base class, adding a functionality that makes use of
    types defined by the triangulation data structure like Face_handle
    or Vertex_handle.
  - New classes `Triangulation_vertex_base_with_info_2` (and 3) and
    `Triangulation_face_base_with_info_2` (and 3) to make easier the
    customisation of base classes in most cases.

### 2D Triangulation
  - Regular triangulation provides an easy access to hidden points.
  - The `Triangulation_hierarchy_2`, which provides an efficient location
    data structure, can now be used with any 2D triangulation class plugged
    in (including regular triangulations).

### 3D Triangulation
  - Faster vertex removal function in `Delaunay_triangulation_3`.
  - `Delaunay_triangulation_3` is now independent of the order of insertions
     of the points (in case of degenerate cosphericity).
  - `Regular_triangulation_3` now hides vertices (and updates itself) when
    inserting a coinciding point with greater weight.  This required a new
    predicate.
  - Deprecated functions: `copy_triangulation()`, `push_back()`,
    `set_number_of_vertices()`.
  - `Triangulation_3` now gives non-const access to its data structure.

### Planar Maps and Arrangements
  The changes concern mainly the traits classes.
  - New traits hierarchy and interface:
    The set of requirements was made sound and complete. A couple of
    requirements were eliminated, few others were redefined, and some
    were renamed. A hierarchy of three traits classes for the
    `Planar_map_2`, `Planar_map_with_intersections_2`, and `Arrangement_2`
    types was established to include only the necessary requirements at
    each level. It was determined that for the aggregate insertion-
    operation based on a sweep-line algorithm only a subset of the
    requirements is needed. Preconditions were added where appropriate
    to tighten the requirements further.
  - The following functions have been renamed:
    - `point_is_same()` renamed to `point_equal()`
    - `curve_is_same()` renamed to `curve_equal()`
    - `curve_is_in_x_range()` renamed to `point_in_x_range()`
    - `curve_compare_at_x()` renamed to `curves_compare_y_at_x()`.
      Furthermore, a precondition has been added that the reference
      point is in the x-range of both curves.
    - `curve_compare_at_x_right()` renamed to `curves_compare_y_at_x_to_right()`.
      Furthermore, a precondition has been added that both curves are
      equal at the reference point and defined to its right.
    - `curve_compare_at_x_left()` renamed to `curves_compare_y_at_x_to_left()`.
      Furthermore, a precondition has been added that both curves are
      equal at the reference point and defined to its right.
    - `curve_get_point_status()` renamed to `curve_compare_y_at_x()`.
      Furthermore, a precondition has been added that the point is in
      the x-range of the curve. Consequently, the function now returns a
      Comparison_result (instead of a special enum).
    - `make_x_monotone()` renamed to `curve_make_x_monotone()`. See more details below.
    - `curve_flip()` renamed to `curve_opposite()`
  - The following functions have been removed:
    - `curve_is_between_cw()`
    - `point_to_left()`
    - `point_to_right()`
    - `is_x_monotone()`
    - `point_reflect_in_x_and_y()`
    - `curve_reflect_in_x_and_y()`
    - `do_intersect_to_right()`
    - `do_intersect_to_left()`
  - Most functions, are required by the `PlanarMapTraits_2` concept,
    except for the `make_x_monotone()`, `nearest_intersection_to_right()`,
    `nearest_intersection_to_left()`, `curves_overlap()` and
    `curve_opposite()`. `PlanarMapWithIntersectionsTraits_2` requires all
    these functions, except `curve_opposite()`, needed only by the
    `ArrangementTraits_2` concept.
    Furthermore, the two functions `curve_compare_at_x_left()` and
    `nearest_intersection_to_left()` can be omitted, if the two functions
    `point_reflect_in_x()` and `curve_reflect_in_x()` are implemented.
    Reflection can be avoided, if the two _left functions are supplied.
  - The type X_curve_2 of the PlanarMapWithIntersectionsTraits_2
    concept was renamed to X_monotone_curve_2, and the distinction
    between this type and the Curve_2 type was made firm. The method
    `is_x_monotone()` of the PlanarMapWithIntersectionsTraits_2 concept
    was removed. The related method `curve_make_x_monotone()` is now
    called for each input curve of type Curve_2 when curves are inserted
    into a Planar_map_with_intersections_2 to subdivide the input curve
    into x-monotone sub-curves (and in case the curve is already
    x-monotone, this function is responsible for casting it to an
    x-monotone curve).
  - New and improved traits classes:
    - Conic traits - `Arr_conic_traits_2`
      Support finite segments of ellipses, hyperbolas and parabolas, as
      well as line segments. The traits require an exact real number-
      type, such as leda_real or `CORE::Expr`.
    - Segment cached traits - `Arr_segment_cached_traits_2`
      This class uses an improved representation for segments that helps
      avoiding cascaded computations, thus achieving faster running
      times. To work properly, an exact rational number-type should be
      used.
    - Polyline traits - `Arr_polyline_traits_2`
      The polyline traits class has been reimplemented to work in a more
      efficient, generic manner. The new class replaces the obsolete
      Arr_polyline_traits class. It is parameterized with a segment
      traits class.
    - Hyperbola and segment traits - `Arr_hyper_segment_traits_2`
      Supports line segments and segments of canonical hyperbolas.
      This is the type of curves that arise when projecting segments
      in three-space rotationally around a line onto a plane containing
      the line. Such projections are often useful in CAD/CAM problems.
  - Removed old traits class:
    - The models of the `PlanarMapWithIntersectionsTraits_2` concept
      below became obsolete, as the new conic traits, namely
      `Arr_conic_traits_2`, supports the same functionality and is much
      more efficient.
     - `Arr_circles_real_traits`
     - `Arr_segment_circle_traits`
  - The segment traits class and the new polyline traits class were
    reimplemented using standard CGAL-kernel calls. This essentially
    eliminated the corresponding leda traits classes, namely:
     - `Pm_leda_segment_traits_2`
     - `Arr_leda_segment_traits_2`
     - `Arr_leda_polyline_traits`
  - With the use of the Leda_rat_kernel new external package the same
    functionality can be achieved with less overhead and more
    efficiency.
  - New interface functions to the `Planar_map_with_intersections_2` class.
    The Planar_map_with_intersections_2 class maintains a planar map of
    input curves that possibly intersect each other and are not necessarily
    x-monotone. If an input curve, or a set of input curves, are known to
    be x-monotone and pairwise disjoint, the new functions below can be
    used to insert them into the map efficiently.

### 2D Sweep Line
  - The `Sweep_line_2` package was reimplemented. As a consequence it is much
    more efficient, its traits is tighter (namely neither the two _left nor
    the reflection functions are required), and its interface has changed a bit.
  - The following global functions have been removed:
    - `sweep_to_produce_subcurves_2()`
    - `sweep_to_produce_points_2()`
    - `sweep_to_construct_planar_map_2()`
  - Instead, the public methods of the Sweep_line_2 class listed below were introduced:
    - `get_subcurves()` - Given a container of curves, this function
       returns a list of curves that are created by intersecting the
       input curves.
    - `get_intersection_points()` - Given a range of curves, this function
       returns a list of points that are the intersection points of the
       curves.
    - `get_intersecting_curves()` - Given a range of curves, this function
       returns an iterator to the beginning of a range that contains the
       list of curves for each intersection point between any two curves
       in the specified range.
  - It is possible to construct a planar map with intersections (or an
    arrangement) by inserting a range of curves into an empty map. This
    will invoke the sweep-line process to construct the map more
    efficiently.

### Polyhedral Surface
  - The old design that was deprecated since CGAL 2.3 has been removed.
  - Class `Polyhedron_incremental_builder_3`:
  - Renamed local enum `ABSOLUTE` to `ABSOLUTE_INDEXING`, and `RELATIVE` to
      `RELATIVE_INDEXING` to avoid conflicts with similarly named macros of another library.
  - Changed member functions `add_vertex()`, `begin_facet()`, and `end_facet()` to return
      useful handles.
  - Added `test_facet()` to check facets for validity before adding them.
  - Added `vertex( size_t i)` to return `Vertex_handle` for index `i`.

### Halfedge Data Structure
  - The old design that was deprecated since CGAL 2.3 has been removed.

### Support Library
  - New container class `Compact_container`, which (roughly) provides the
    flexibility of `std::list`, with the memory compactness of std::vector.
  - Geomview_stream: added a function
      gv.draw_triangles(InputIterator begin, InputIterator end)
      which draws a set of triangles much more quickly than one by one.

#### Number types:
  - number types are now required to provide a function:
    `std::pair<double, double>  to_interval(const NT&)`.
  - number types are now required to provide mixed operators with "int".
  - CLN support removed.
  - faster `square()` for MP_Float.
  - added Gmp_q.

#### Qt_widget:
  - New classes:
    - `Qt_help_window`: provides a simple way to show some helpful
      information about a demo as an HTML page.
    - `Qt_widget_history`: provides basic functionality to manipulate
      intervals of `Qt_widget` class. The current visible area of `Qt_widget`
      is mapped to an interval. Each interval could be stored in the
      `Qt_widget_history` object. So you can use this object to navigate in
      history.  It is mostly used by `Qt_widget_standard_toolbar`.
  - Changes:
    - Qt_widget_standard_toolbar: is derived from QToolBar class, so pay
      attention to modify your code, if you used this class. Some public
      methods were introduced to control the history object that the
      toolbar use to navigate.
    - The icons are now part of libCGALQt.
  - Deprecated members of Qt_widget:
    - `add_to_history()`, `clear_history()`, `back()`, `forth()`: use `forward()`,
      `back()` and `clear_history()` of the `Qt_widget_standard_toolbar` instead.
    - `custom_redraw()`: use `redraw_on_back()` and `redraw_on_front()` instead.
  - Optimizations:
     - The output operators of the following classes have been optimized:
     - `CGAL::Segment_2` (now tests for intersection with the drawing area)
     - `CGAL::Triangle_2` (now tests for intersection with the drawing area)
     - `CGAL::Triangulation_2` (is optimized for faster display on zooming)

### Erratum in the Kernel manual

#### Intersection test routines
  - The documentation of CGAL::do_intersect should mention, for the 3D case:
    also, in three-dimensional space `Type1` can be either `Plane_3<Kernel>`
      or `Triangle_3<Kernel>` and `Type2` any of:
    - `Plane_3<Kernel>`
    - `Line_3<Kernel>`
    - `Ray_3<Kernel>`
    - `Segment_3<Kernel>`
    - `Triangle_3<Kernel>`
  - In the same way, for `Kernel::DoIntersect_3`: for all pairs `Type1` and `Type2`, where the type `Type1` is either `Kernel::Plane_3`
    or `Kernel::Triangle_3` and `Type2` can be any of the following:
    - `Kernel::Plane_3`
    - `Kernel::Line_3`
    - `Kernel::Ray_3`
    - `Kernel::Segment_3`
    - `Kernel::Triangle_3`
  - Philippe Guigue (I<small>NRIA</small> Sophia-Antipolis) should be mentioned as one of the authors.
