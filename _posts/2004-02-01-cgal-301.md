## Changelog

### Polyhedral Surface

-   Fixed wrong include files for output support. Added example.

### Planar\_map

-   Fixed the so called "Walk-along-a-line" point-location strategy to
    correctly handle a degenerate case.

### 2D Triangulation

-   added missing figure in html doc.
-   in Line\_face\_circulator\_2.h:
    Fixed changes made to support handles with a typedef to iterator.
    The fix concerns operator== and !=.

### Alpha\_shapes\_3

-   Fixed classify member function for edges.

### Number types

-   Lazy\_exact\_nt:
    -   added the possibility to select the relative precision of
        `to_double()` (by default 1e-5). This should fix reports that
        some circumcenters computations have poor coordinates, e.g.
        nan).
    -   when exact computation is triggered, the interval is recomputed,
        this should speed up some kinds of computations.
-   `to_interval(Quotient<MP_Float>)`: avoid spurious overflows.

### Kernel

-   missing acknowledgment in the manual and minor clarification of
    `intersection()` documentation.
