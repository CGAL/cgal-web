<p>This is a bug-fix release.
No new features have been added in 3.0.1.  Here is the list of bug-fixes.<p>

<H3> Polyhedral Surface</H3>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed wrong include files for output support. Added example.</li>
</ul>

<H3>Planar_map</H3>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed the so called "Walk-along-a-line" point-location strategy to
      correctly handle a degenerate case.</li>
</ul>

<H3>2D Triangulation</H3>

<ul>
  <li> added missing figure in html doc</li>
  <li> in  Line_face_circulator_2.h:<br>
       Fixed changes made to support handles with a typedef to iterator.
       The fix concerns operator== and !=.</li>
</ul>

<H3>Alpha_shapes_3</H3>

<ul>
  <li>fixed classify member function for edges.</li>
</ul>


<H3>  Number types</H3>

<ul>
  <li>Lazy_exact_nt:
    <ul>
      <li>added the possibility to select the relative precision of
          <tt>to_double()</tt> (by default 1e-5).  This should fix reports
          that some circumcenters computations have poor coordinates,
          e.g. nan).</li>
      <li>when exact computation is triggered, the interval is recomputed,
          this should speed up some kinds of computations.</li>
    </ul>
  <li><tt>to_interval(Quotient&lt;MP_Float&gt;)</tt>: avoid spurious overflows.</li></li>
</ul>

<H3>Kernel</H3>

<ul>
  <li>
  missing acknowledgment in the manual and minor clarification of

     <tt>intersection()</tt> documentation.</li>
