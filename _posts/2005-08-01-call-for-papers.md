<h1>CALL FOR PAPERS</h1>

<h2>Special Issue of<br>
    Computational Geometry: Theory and Applications<br>
    on<br>
    CGAL - the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library</h2>
</center>

<p><b>Submission deadline:  March 1, 2006</b></p>

<p>The international journal Computational Geometry: Theory and
Applications is planning a special issue on CGAL, the Computational
Geometry Algorithms Library. CGAL is an open source C++ library, see
<a href="http://www.cgal.org">http://www.cgal.org</a>. Its goal is to
make the most important methods developed in computational geometry
available to users in industry and academia, by providing easy access
to robust and generic geometric algorithms.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>We solicit original research papers describing contributions to CGAL, 
or applications critically using CGAL. Topics of interest include 
implementations of known and new algorithms in computational geometry, 
the design of generic software, algorithm engineering aspects, experimental 
verification, and benchmarking.</p>

<p>Work describing contributions to CGAL should be related to existing
packages, or to new packages submitted to the CGAL editorial board.
Formally, acceptance is independent of the package reviewing process, 
but the opinion of the editorial board will be a factor in the 
decision.</p>

<p>Work describing applications should clearly state in which way 
the application depends on CGAL, and why the usage of CGAL is
crucial for its functionality.</p>

<h2>Format</h2>

<p>We ask for regular papers, not source code, not documentation. It
is expected that the paper provides a link to source code, and there
may be code fragments also in the paper to show how some functionality
is used or realized.  Full versions of previous conference papers are
encouraged.<p>

<h2>Important dates</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Submission Deadline: March 1, 2006</li>
  <li>Acceptance Decision: July 1, 2006</li>
  <li>Final version due: November 1, 2006</li>
</ul>

<p>All efforts will be made to ensure timeliness of the special issue.
Please submit only if you are able to deliver the final version of
your accepted paper by the indicated date. </p>

<p>Electronic submission is preferred. Please email a PostScript or PDF
file of your manuscript together with a cover letter to either of the
two guest editors of this special issue:</p>

<p><tt>Bernd.Gaertner</tt>&nbsp;(at)&nbsp;<tt>inf.ethz.ch</tt> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<tt>Remco.Veltkamp</tt>&nbsp;(at)&nbsp;<tt>cs.uu.nl</tt></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can send 4 hardcopies to one of the editors:</p>

<p>Bernd Gärtner<br>
Institute for Theoretical Computer Science <br>
ETH Zürich<br>
CH-8092 Zürich<br>
Switzerland</p>

<p>All submissions will be refereed following the usual high standards of
the journal. Additional information can be obtained by communicating 
with the special issue guest editors.</p>
