## Changelog

### Number Types
  - Fixed MP_Float constructor which crashed for some values.

### Kernel
  - Renamed Bool to avoid a clash with a macro in X11 headers.

### Arrangement
  - Derived the `Arr_segment_traits_2 Arrangement_2` traits class from
    the parameterized Kernel. This allows the use of this traits class
    in an extended range of applications that require kernel objects and
    operations on these objects beyond the ones required by the
    `Arrangement_2` class itself.
  - Fixed a compilation bug in the code that handles overlay of
    arrangements instantiated with different DCEL classes.
  - Fixed a couple of bugs in the implementation of the Trapezoidal RIC point-location strategy.

### Triangulation, Alpha Shapes
  - Qualify calls to `filter_iterator` with `CGAL::` to avoid overload
    ambiguities with Boost's `filter_iterator`.

### Surface Mesher
  - Fixed a bug in iterators of the class template `Surface_mesh_complex_2_in_triangulation_3`.

### Surface Mesh Parametrisation
  - Updated the precompiled taucs lib.

### Kinetic Data Structures
  - Fixed problems caused by old versions of gcc being confused by `operator!` and operator `int()`.
  - Added point removal support to the `Active_objects_vector`.
