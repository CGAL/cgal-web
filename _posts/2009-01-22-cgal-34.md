<p>CGAL 3.4 differs from <a href="../../../../2007/09/04/cgal-331">CGAL 3.3.1</a> in the platforms that are supported and
in functionality. There have also been a number of bug fixes for this release.</p>

## Changelog

### General

-   GNU g++ 4.3 supported. Support for g++ 3.3 is dropped.
-   Visual 9 supported. Support for Visual 7 is dropped.
-   Boost version 1.33 at least is now required.
-   CGAL now depends on Boost.Threads, which implies to link against a
    compiled part of Boost.
-   The new macro CGAL_NO_DEPRECATED_CODE can be defined to disable
    deprecated code, helping users discover if they rely on code that
    may be removed in subsequent releases.
-   Assertion behaviour: It is not possible anymore to set the CONTINUE
    mode for assertion failures. Functions that allow to change the
    assertion behaviour are now declared in
    `<CGAL/assertions_behaviour.h>`.
-   Qt3 based demos are still there but the documentation has been
    removed as the CGAL::Qt_Widget will be deprecated.
-   Qt4 based demos use the Qt GraphicsView framework and the
    libQGLViewer.

### Installation

-   `install_cgal` has been replaced by CMake.

### Polynomial (new package)

-   This package introduces a concept, `Polynomial_d`, for
    multivariate polynomials in `d` variables.

### Modular Arithmetic (new package)

-   This package provides arithmetic over finite fields.

### Number Types

-   The counter `Interval_nt::number_of_failures()` has been removed,
    replaced by a profiling counter enabled with `CGAL_PROFILE`.
-   Fix of a bug in `CORE/Expr.h`. As a consequence, the arrangement demo
    works properly when handling arrangements of conics, for example,
    when defining an arc with 5 points.

### 3D Spherical Geometry Kernel (new package)

-   This package is an extension of the linear CGAL Kernel. It offers
    functionalities on spheres, circles, circular arcs and line segments
    in the 3D space.

### Linear Kernel

-   We recommend that you use the `object_cast()` function instead of
    `assign()` to extract an object from a `CGAL::Object`, for efficiency
    reasons.
-   The Kernel archetypes provided by the 2D/3D linear kernel have been
    removed.
-   The deprecated linear kernel functors `Construct_supporting_line_2`
    and `Construct_supporting_line_3` have been removed.
-   Ambiant_dimension and Feature_dimenison have been added to
    retrieve the potentially compile-time dimension of a space or of an
    object.
-   `barycenter()` functions have been added.
-   The geometric object `Circle_3` as well as predicates and
    constructions have been added to the kernel
-   The missing intersection/do_intersect between `Line_3` and `Line_3`
    has been added as well.

### 3D Triangulations

-   Removed the deprecated functions `Cell:mirror_index()` and `Cell::mirror_vertex()`.
-   Derecursification of two functions that in some cases lead to stack overflows.

### 3D Nef Polyhedron

-   n-ary union/intersection.
-   intersection with halfspace under standard kernel.
-   constructor for polylines.

### CGAL and the Qt4 GraphicsView (new package)

-   2D CGAL Kernel objects and many data structures have can be rendered in a QGraphicsView.

### STL Extensions:

-   The functor adaptors for argument binding and composition (bind_\*,
    compose, compose_shared, swap_\*, negate, along with the helper
    functions set_arity_\* and Arity class and Arity_tag typedefs)
    which were provided by `<CGAL/functional.h>` have been removed.
    Please use the better boost::bind mecanism instead. The concept
    AdaptableFunctor has been changed accordingly such that only a
    nested result_type is required.
-   The accessory classes Twotuple, Threetuple, Fourtuple and Sixtuple
    are also deprecated (use CGAL::array instead).
-   `CGAL::Triple` and `CGAL::Quadruple` are in the process of being
    replaced by boost::tuple. As a first step, we strongly recommend
    that you replace the direct access to the data members (`.first`,
    `.second`, `.third`, `.fourth`), by the `get<>()` member function;
    and replace the make_triple and make_quadruple maker functions by
    make_tuple.
    This way, in a further release, we will be able to switch to
    `boost::tuple` more easily.
-   The class `CGAL::Uncertain` has been documented. It is
    typically used to report uncertain results for predicates using
    interval arithmetic, and other filtering techniques.

### 2D Arrangements

-   Changed the name of the arrangement package from `Arrangement_2` to
    `Arrangement_on_surface_2` to reflect the potential capabilities of
    the package to construct and maintain arrangements induced by curves
    embedded on two dimensional surfaces in three space. Most of these
    capabilities will become available only in future releases though.
-   Enhanced the geometry traits concept to handle arrangements embedded
    on surfaces. Each geometry-traits class must now define the
    'Boundary_category' tag.
-   Fixed a bug in `Arr_polyline_traits_2.h`, where the operator that
    compares two curves failed to evaluate the correct result (true)
    when the curves are different, but their graphs are identical.
-   Permanently removed `IO/Arr_postscript_file_stream.h` and
    `IO/Polyline_2_postscript_file_stream.h`, as they depend on
    obsolete features and LEDA.
-   Fixed several bugs in the arrangement demo and enhanced it. e.g.,
    fixed background color change, allowed vertex coloring , enabled
    "smart" color selection, etc.
-   Enhanced the arrangement demo with new features, such as allowing
    the abortion of the merge function (de-select), updated the how-to
    description, etc.
-   Replace the functions `CGAL::insert_curve()`, `CGAL::insert_curves()`,
    `CGAL::insert_x_monotone_curve()`, and
    `CGAL::insert_x_monotone_curves()` with a single overloaded
    function `CGAL::insert()`. The former 4 functions are now deprecated,
    and may no longer be supported in future releases.

### Envelopes of Surfaces in 3D

-   Fixed a bug in the computation of the envelope of unbounded planes
    caused by multiple removals of vertices at infinity.

### 2D Regularized Boolean Set-Operations

-   Fixed a bug in `connect_holes()` that caused failures when connecting
    holes touching the outer boundary.
-   Fixed the concept `GeneralPolygonSetTraits_2`. Introduced two new
    `concepts GpsTraitsGeneralPolygon_2` and
    `GpsTraitsGeneralPolygonWithHoles_2`. Fixed the definition of the two
    nested required types `Polygon_2` and `Polygon_with_holes_2` of the
    `GeneralPolygonSetTraits_2` concept. They must model now the two new
    concepts above.
-   Added a default template parameter to `General_polygon_set_2` to
    allow users to pass their specialized DCEL used to instantiate the
    underlying arrangement.
-   Enhanced the BOP demo to use multiple windows.

### 2D Minkowski Sums

-   Fixed a few bugs in the approximate offset function, making it
    robust to highly degenerate inputs.
-   Fixed a bug in the exact Minkowski sum computation when processing
    degenerate inputs that induce overlapping of contiguous segments in
    the convolution cycles.
-   Optimized the approximate offset function (reduced time consumption
    up to a factor of 2 in some cases).
-   Added functionality to compute the offset (or to approximate the
    offset) of a `Polygon_with_holes_2` (and not just of a `Polygon_2`).
-   Added the functionality to compute (or to approximate) the inner
    offset of a polygon.
