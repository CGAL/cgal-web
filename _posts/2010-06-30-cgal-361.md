<p>
  This is a bug fix release. The following has been changed
  since CGAL-3.6:</p>

<h3>General</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Fix compilation errors with recent Boost versions (since 1.40).</li>

  <li> Initial support for the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler 10.0 (MSVC
    2010). For that support, CMake>=2.8.2 is required.
    Note also that the compiler option "/bigobj" is necessary to compile
    some CGAL programs with MSVC 2010.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Polynomial</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fix compilation errors with the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler and the
    Intel C++ compiler.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Polyhedron</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Fix a compilation errors in demo/Polyhedron/:</li>
  <li> issue with the location of qglobal.h of Qt4 on MacOS X,</li>
  <li> missing texture.cpp, if TAUCS is used,</li>
  <li> Fix the location of built plugins of demo/Polyhedron/, when CGAL is
    configured with WITH_demos=ON</li>
</ul>

<h3> 3D Periodic Triangulations</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Fixed bug in the triangulation hierarchy for periodic triangulations.</li>
</ul>

<h3> 2D Mesh Generation</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Fix a bug that lead to precondition violation.</li>
  <li> Improve the user manual about the member function is_in_domain() of the
    Face type.</li>
  <li> The 2D meshing process is now deterministic (sorting of bad faces no
    longer relies on pointers comparisons).</li>
</ul>

<h3> 3D Mesh Generation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fix a linking errors (duplicate symbols) when <code>&lt;CGAL/refine_mesh_3.h&gt;</code> is
    included in different compilation units.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Spatial Searching</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Fix a bug in <code>&lt;CGAL/Orthogonal_k_neighbor_search.h&gt;</code> when several
    nearest neighbors are at the same distance from the query point.</li>
</ul>

<h3> IO Streams</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fix a bug in <code>&lt;CGAL/IO/VRML_2_ostream.h&gt;</code> that generated VRML 2 files with
    an invalid syntax for IndexedFaceSet nodes.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Triangulation_2</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Add missing Compare_distance_2 functor in trait classes Triangulation_euclidean_traits_xy_3
    Triangulation_euclidean_traits_yz_3 and Triangulation_euclidean_traits_xz_3.
    This was preventing calling member function nearest_vertex of Delaunay_triangulation_2
    instantiated with one of these traits.</li>
</ul>
