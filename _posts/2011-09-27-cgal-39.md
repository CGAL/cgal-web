<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The class <code>Root_of_2</code> is now deprecated. It is recommended to use the class <code>Sqrt_extension</code> instead.</li>
  <li>The class <code>Sqrt_extension</code> is now used everywhere in CGAL where an algebraic number of degree 2 is needed.
    This change has been done in the <code>Root_of_traits</code> mechanism (indirectly packages 2D Circular kernel and 3D Spherical kernel)
    and the packages 2D Segment Delaunay Graphs and 2D Arrangements.</li>
  <li>Various fixes in the manual.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Combinatorial Maps (new package)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This package provides a new combinatorial data structure allowing to describe any orientable subdivided object whatever its dimension.
    It describes all cells of the subdivision and all the incidence and adjacency relations between these cells.
    For example it allows to describe a 3D object subdivided in vertices, edges, faces and volumes.
    This data structure can be seen as the generalization in dD of the halfedge data structure.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3D Convex Hull (major performance improvement)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The quickhull implementation of CGAL (<code>CGAL::convex_hull_3</code>)
    has been worked out to provide very better performances.</li>
  <li>The function <code>CGAL::convex_hull_3</code> no longer computes the plane
    equations of the facets of the output polyhedron. However an example is
    provided to show how to compute them easily.</li>
  <li>A global function <code>convex_hull_3_to_polyhedron_3</code> is now provided to extract
    the convex hull of a 3D points set from a triangulation of these points.</li>
</ul>

<h3>dD Spatial Searching (major new feature added)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A traits-class and distance adapter that together with a point property map,
    allow to make nearest neighbor queries on keys instead of points have been added.</li>
  <li>Few bug fixes in the documentation have revealed some inconsistencies
    that have been corrected. Two traits class concept are now documented (<code>RangeSearchTraits</code>
    and <code>SearchTraits</code>). Most other changes concerns only classes documented as advanced.
    One issue that user can encounter is due to an additional requirement on the nested
    class <code>Construct_cartesian_const_iterator_d</code> defined in the concept SearchTraits that must
    provide a nested type <code>result_type</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Spatial Sorting  (major new feature added)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>General dimension is now supported.</li>
  <li>Hilbert sorting admits now two policies: splitting at
    median or at middle (see user manual).</li>
  <li>Using a property map, sorting on keys instead of points is now easier</li>
</ul>

<h3>dD Kernel</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The d-dimensional kernel concept and models have been modified
    to additionally provide two new functors <code>Less_coordinate_d</code> and <code>Point_dimension_d</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2D Arrangements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A new geometry-traits class that handles rational arcs, namely
    <code>Arr_rational_function_traits_2</code>, has been introduced.
    It replaced an old traits class, which handled the same family of
    curves, but it was less efficient. The new traits exploits CGAL
    algebraic kernels and polynomials, which were not available at
    the time the old traits class was developed.</li>
  <li>A new geometry traits concept called
    <code>ArrangementOpenBoundaryTraits_2</code> has been introduced.
    A model of this concept supports curves that approach the open
    boundary of an iso-rectangular area called parameter space, which can
    be unbounded or bounded. The general code of the package, however,
    supports only the unbounded parameter space. We intend to enhance the
    general code to support also bounded parameter spaces in a future
    release.</li>
  <li>The deprecated member function <code>is_at_infinity()</code> of
    <code>Arrangement_2::Vertex</code> has been removed. It has been previously
    replaced new function <code>is_at_open_boundary()</code>.

  <li> The tags in the geometry traits that indicate the type of boundary of
    the embedding surface were replaced by the following new tags:
    <pre>
      Left_side_category
      Bottom_side_category
      Top_side_category
      Right_side_category
    </pre>
    It is still possible not to indicate the tags at all. Default values are assumed. This however will
    produce warning messages, and should be avoided.</li>
</ul>
