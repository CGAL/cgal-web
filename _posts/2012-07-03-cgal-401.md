<p>
  This is a bug fix release. Apart various minor fixes in the documentation,
  the following has been changed since CGAL-4.0:</p>

<h3> 2D Voronoi Diagram Adaptor (re-added)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The package <em>2D Voronoi Diagram Adaptor</em> was temporarily
    removed from the CGAL distribution because of license issues. That
    package is now back into CGAL.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>2D and 3D Geometry Kernel </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fix a bug in the <code>Segment_3-Triangle_3</code> intersection function in the case the segment is collinear with a triangle edge.</li>
  <li>Fix a bug in the <code>Projection_traits_.._3</code> class in the case a segment was parallel to the x-axis.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Algebraic Kernel</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid the linking error "duplicate symbols" when two compilation units
    using the algebraic kernel are linked.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3D Boolean Operations on Nef Polygons Embedded on the Sphere</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fix a memory leak due to the usage of an internal mechanism that has
    been replaced by <code>boost::any</code>. This also influences the
    packages 2D Boolean Operations on Nef Polygons, 3D Boolean Operations on
    Nef Polyhedra, Convex Decomposition of Polyhedra, and 3D Minkowski Sum of
    Polyhedra.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2D Arrangement</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fix several memory leaks.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2D Mesh Generation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fix a compilation error in the
    header <code>&lt;CGAL/Mesh_2/Do_not_refine_edges.h&gt;</code> when g++
    version 4.7 is used.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Surface Mesh Generation and 3D Mesh Generation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fix an important bug in the <code>CGAL_ImageIO</code> library, that
    could lead to wrong result when meshing from a 3D image.</li>
  <li>Fix the compilation of the demo in <code>demo/Surface_mesher</code>,
    when Boost version 1.48 or 1.49 is used.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Surface Mesh Parameterization</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fix a memory leak.</li>
  <li>Fix a compatibility issue with Eigen-3.1 of <code>Eigen_solver_traits</code>. This fix also affects the usage of
    that class in the package <i>Surface Reconstruction from Point Sets</i>.</li>
</ul>
