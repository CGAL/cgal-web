<p>
Changing a logo is a big decision, source of controversies
and only in the long run we will see if we made a good choice.
</p>

<p>
As the CGAL Project is an Open Source project, we like transparency
and that's why we decided to present you how it came to the new
logo, and what alternatives we explored. At the end you will see
that the choice we made was simply natural.
</p>

<p>
As an Open Source project we also would appreciate to get user feeback,
as the only people who count for us are you, the users.
</p>

<h4>The Problem with the Old Logo</h4>

<p>
The old CGAL logo used letters constructed with compass and rulers,
as described in the  book written by
<a href="http://www.goines.net/">David Lance Goines</a>:
<i>A Constructed Roman Alphabet: a Geometric Analysis
of the Greek and Roman Capitals and of the Arabic Numerals.</i> 
David R. Gordine, Boston, 1982.
</p>

<p>
«<em>
Construct first a square ABCD, and bisect AC at E, BD at F, AB at G, and CD
at H. Draw the straight lines EF and GH, thereby establishing a point I at
their intersection. From the center I, describe a circle JIK on EF, the diameter
of which is one-ninth the distance AB. Using that same radius, describe
a circle LJI, thereby establishing a point N on the perimeter of the
circle I. ....... </em>»
</p>

<p>
Although CGAL developers
liked these constructions a lot, the CGAL Editorial Board had to make a drastic change. An
opinion poll performed among decision makers in the computer graphics industry during Siggraph 2012 showed 
that the CGAL project started to be perceived as old fashioned.
</p>

<h4>Idea</h4>
<p>
Several desperate brain storming sessions later, the breakthrough idea came by coincidence,
when we met  Madeleine Ouette, the cover designer at O'Reilly, in order to choose the 
animal for the upcoming CGAL book. For Madeleine a 
<a target="webster" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/seagull"><em>seagull</em></a> 
was the most natural choice as the word is a 
<a target="webster" href="https://media.merriam-webster.com/audio/prons/en/us/mp3/s/seagul01.mp3">homophone</a>
for <em>CGAL</em>, and we were lucky that it was not already taken.
</p>

<p>
A quick word on the book: It is about CGAL 5.0 which will be released in September 2013. 
The change of the major release number is due to the fact, that we fully exploit the
features of C++11, that is lamdas, the auto type, variadic templates, decltype, etc.
This will lead to some compilers no longer being supported, and some CGAL users having to 
revise their C++ language skills (hence the book), but it leads to a phenomenal clarity 
and elegance of the CGAL APIs. We simply had to do it.

<h4>A Drawing is Not a Logo</h4>

<p>
Having the seagull on the CGAL book, and the fact that this bird is elegant and dynamic, 
led to the decision to come up with a "seagull" logo. We were tempted to simply take the 
drawing of the O'Reilly CGAL book, but this was impossible because O'Reilly considers 
these drawings as part of their brand. The next idea was to find a cool picture of 
a seagull flying through a stormy sky.

<p>
Luckily we contacted an expert in logos and brand development.
</p>

<p>
«<em>A logo is an abstraction</em>»  explained Mark Höwe,  Chief Creative of 
the web agency Haatchi&amp;Haatchi, and he illustrated what he meant
with the images on the right.

«<em>CGAL is not a zoo, right!</em>»  Mark said, and he continued
«<em>Was CGAL an application like Picasa, inkscape, or gimp, a painting would 
have been a serious option.</em>» 
</p>

<p>
Here we are in 3D.

We see quad meshes flying rapidly over a terrain model.
Additionally, we see the mesh at two levels of detail.  
«<em>In a world of devices ranging from smartphones, over tablets,
to workstations with huge screens, multi resolution algorithms are key!</em>»
according to Mark, and he added  «<em>As Samsung Maps  and Huawei Maps also enter 
the market of GIS for the masses, a logo with a terrain model, makes 
absolute sense for a geometry library like CGAL.»</em>
</p>

<p>
If CGAL was only 2D algorithms this tangram would have worked too.
«<em>The fact that it is composed of basic shapes which can be recombined
in an unlimited number of ways captures the essence of CGAL.</em>» Mark said. </td>

<p>
The outline is easy to recognize, but because it can be seen on many
windows to avoid real birds hitting the window, it is almost impossible 
to establish a new connotation between the shape and the geometry
library.
