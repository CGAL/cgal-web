## Changelog

### The CGAL Manual

-   The documentation of CGAL is now generated with Doxygen.

### 2D Periodic Triangulations (new package)

-   This package allows to build and handle triangulations of point sets
    in the two-dimensional flat torus. Triangulations are built
    incrementally and can be modified by insertion or removal of
    vertices. They offer point location facilities. The package provides
    Delaunay triangulations and offers nearest neighbor queries and
    primitives to build the dual Voronoi diagrams.

### API Changes

#### 2D and 3D Geometry Kernel

-   The intersection functions and functors used to return a
    `CGAL::Object` in order to deal with the different possible return
    types. However, depending on the arguments it is possible to reduce
    the possible return types to a small set. For this reason and to
    take advantage of the type safety, we decided to use
    `boost::variant` instead of `CGAL::Object`. The `result_of` protocol
    is now even more useful to determine the return type of the
    intersection functions and functors. The change should be relatively
    transparent to the user thanks to the implicit constructor added to
    `CGAL::Object`. However, it is recommended to upgrade your code. The
    previous behavior can be restored by defining the macro
    `CGAL_INTERSECTION_VERSION` to 1.

#### 2D Arrangements

-   The type of the result of point location queries changed to
    `boost::variant` (from `CGAL::Object`). For convenience, the
    previous behavior can be restored by defining the macro
    `CGAL_ARR_POINT_LOCATION_VERSION` to 1.
-   Introduced an optimization for operations on large and dense
    arrangements.

#### 3D Fast Intersection and Distance Computation

-   Following the intersection API change, `Object_and_primitive_id` has
    been replaced by a template class
    `Intersection_and_primitive_id<Query>` to determine the type
    depending on the query object type.

#### CGAL and Boost Property Maps

-   The `key_type` of the property maps provided by CGAL used to be an
    iterator. In order to be more easily re-used, the `key_type` has
    been changed to be the `value_type` of the iterator. The packages
    that have been updated to match these changes are **Point Set
    Processing** and **Surface Reconstruction from Point Sets**.
    However, for most users this change should be transparent if the
    default property maps were used. For convenience, the former
    behavior can be enabled by defining the macro
    `CGAL_USE_PROPERTY_MAPS_API_V1`.

### Algebraic Foundations

-   For convenience, added an overload of `make_rational()` taking a pair
    of numbers.

### 2D and 3D Geometry Kernel

-   A `Iso_rectangle_2` can now be constructed from a `Bbox_2` and an
    `Iso_cuboid_3` from a `Bbox_3`.
-   The implementation of `CGAL::Object` has been updated and now uses
    `boost::shared_ptr` and `boost::any`. This implementation is faster.
-   Added to `Bbox_2` and `Bbox_3` a `+=` operator as well as free
    functions to get the bounding box of a range of geometric objects.

### Combinatorial Maps

-   Two bug fixes: do not use the 2 least significant bits for cell
    attribute without dart support; share the mark when copying a
    CMap_cell_iterator.
-   Added a constructor taking a given combinatorial map as argument,
    possibly with different dimension and/or different attributes. This
    allows to transform a combinatorial map.
-   Added operator= and swap method.
-   Added dynamic onmerge/onsplit functions that can be associated
    dynamically to i-attributes and which are automatically called when
    i-cells are split/merged.
-   Added a function allowing to reverse the orientation of a
    combinatorial map, and another one to reverse one connected
    component of a combinatorial map.

### 3D Boolean Operations on Nef Polyhedra

-   Bug-fix in IO when using `Lazy_exact_nt` as number type or
    `Exact_predicates_exact_constructions_kernel` as kernel.

### 2D Triangulations

-   Extended the concept `TriangulationDataStructure_2` to require a more
    general `copy_tds` function that allows a copy between TDS of
    different types. The CGAL model has been updated.
-   Added a way to efficiently insert a range of points with information
    into the 2D constrained Delaunay triangulations.

### 3D Triangulations

-   Extended the concept `TriangulationDataStructure_3` to require a more
    general `copy_tds` function that allows a copy between TDS of
    different types. The CGAL model has been updated.
-   Added an advanced function to set the infinite vertex of the
    triangulation for low level operations
-   Fixed a bug in the function inserting a range of points with info when
    the `Fast_location` tag is used

### 2D Segment Delaunay Graph

-   Added functions `insert_points` and `insert_segments` to insert a
    range of points and segments. These functions uses the spatial
    sorting in order to speed up the time needed for the insertion. The
    function
    `insert(Input_iterator first, Input_iterator beyond,       Tag_true)`
    has been updated to dispatch the input when possible to these
    functions.

### 2D Apollonius Graphs

-   Modified insertion algorithm so that the code can handle
    pseudo-circles as well.
-   Updated implementation of the vertex conflict predicate by a faster
    version.

### 3D Mesh Generation

-   Sped-up `Mesh_3` and in particular the global optimizers (Lloyd and
    ODT) by introducing a parameter `do_freeze` to prevent from moving
    vertices which would move of very small displacements.
-   Introduce new data structures and options for speed-up and
    compacity. Note that `Compact_mesh_cell_base_3` and
    `Mesh_vertex_base_3` are now our favoured implementations of the
    concepts MeshCellBase_3 and MeshVertexBase_3.
-   Introduced a new constructor for `Polyhedral_mesh_domain_3` that
    takes a bounding polyhedron to be meshed along with a polyhedral
    surface entirely included in it. This allows the user to mesh a
    polyhedral domain with internal surface(s) which can be
    non-watertight and even non-manifold.
-   Several documentation bug fixes.
-   Provided the ability to plug in custom cell_base/vertex_base
    classes into the `Mesh_triangulation_3` class.

### Triangulated Surface Mesh Simplification

-   Fixed a segmentation fault that was happening when some edges of
    length 0 were in the input mesh.

### 3D Fast Intersection and Distance Computation

-   Following the intersection API change, `Object_and_primitive_id` has
    been replaced by a template class
    `Intersection_and_primitive_id<Query>` to determine the type
    depending on the query object type.
-   Introduced the class `AABB_halfedge_graph_segment_primitive`, which
    replaces the class `AABB_polyhedron_segment_primitive` (which is now
    deprecated). The new class is more general and can be used with any
    model of `HalfedgeGraph`.
-   Introduced the class `AABB_face_graph_triangle_primitive` which
    replaces the class `AABB_polyhedron_triangle_primitive` (which is
    now deprecated).
-   Documented the classes `AABB_segment_primitive` and
    `AABB_triangle_primitive` that were already used in some examples.
-   Add a generic primitive class `AABB_primitive` that allows to define
    a primitive type by defining only two property maps.
-   Introduced a new concept of primitive `AABBPrimitiveWithSharedData`.
    It allows to have some data shared between the primitives stored in
    a `AABB_tree`. With this you can, for example have a primitive
    wrapping an integer which refers to the position of a geometric
    object in a `std::vector`. Only one reference to this vector will be
    stored in the traits of the tree. The concept `AABBTraits`, its
    model `AABB_traits` and the class `AABB_tree` have been updated
    accordingly. However, everything is backward compatible.
-   Fixed a memory leak in the destructor of the class `AABB-tree`

### STL Extensions for CGAL

-   Added to `Dispatch_output_iterator` and
    `Dispatch_or_drop_output_iterator` an operator to accept and
    dispatch a tuple of values.

### Concurrency in CGAL

-   Added a `FindTBB` CMake module so that one can easily link with TBB to
    write shared-memory parallel code.
-   Introduce two new tags: `Sequential_tag` and `Parallel_tag`.
