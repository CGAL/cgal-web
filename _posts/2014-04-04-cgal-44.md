## Changelog

### Installation

-   Additional supported platforms:
    -   The Apple Clang compiler version 5.0 is now supported on
        OS X Mavericks.
    -   The Microsoft Windows Visual C++ compiler 2013 (VC12) is now
        supported.

### Triangulated Surface Mesh Segmentation (new package)

-   This package implements the segmentation of triangulated surface
    meshes based on the Shape Diameter Function (SDF). In addition, it
    also provides functions to generate segmentations based on a user
    defined alternative to the SDF.

### Number Types

-   A new class `CGAL::Mpzf` is introduced on some platforms for exact
    ring operations. It is used to improve the speed of the evaluation
    of predicates in degenerate situations.

### 2D and 3D Geometry Kernel

-   Fixed a bug introduced in CGAL 4.3 when computing the intersection of
    two 3D triangles.

### 2D Polygon Partitioning

-   Bug-fix to make the partition algorithms working with a Lazy kernel
    such as `Exact_predicates_exact_constructions_kernel`.

### 2D Regularized Boolean Set-Operations

-   Fixed two memory leaks in `CGAL::General_polygon_set_2`.

### Combinatorial Maps and Linear Cell Complex

-   `null_dart_handle` is no longer a static data member in the
    `CombinatorialMap` concept. This implies to move the following
    methods of `Dart` concept into `CombinatorialMap` concept:
    `is_free`, `highest_nonfree_dimension`, `opposite` and
    `other_extremity`. We also transform the static methods
    `vertex_attribute` and `point` of `Linear_cell_complex` class into
    non static methods. You can define the CGAL\_CMAP\_DEPRECATED macro
    to keep the old behavior.

### 2D Arrangements

-   Revised the API of **polylines**. In particular, *construction* is
    now done using functors and *iteration* is possible only on the
    segments of a polyline.
-   Fix a bug in the *Landmark* point-location strategy.

### 2D Snap Rounding

-   Fixed a memory leak

### 2D Triangulations

-   Added different overloads of the function `insert_constraints` that
    inserts a range of points and segments, or a range of segments.
    These functions uses the spatial sorting in order to speed up the
    time needed for the insertion.

### 3D Alpha Shapes

-   Added member functions in `CGAL::Alpha_shape_3` to give access to the
    alpha status of edges and facets (`get_alpha_status())`.
-   Added another filtration method (`filtration_with_alpha_values()`)
    that reports the alpha value at which each face appears in the
    filtration.

### 3D Mesh Generation

-   Fixed the access to functions `number_of_facets` and `number_of_cells`
    in `Mesh_complex_3_in_triangulation_3`.
-   Changed the internal API of the sliver perturber, to make possible
    for developers to optimize another criterion than the (default)
    minimal dihedral angle. Developers can also define a new
    perturbation vector (for angles we had gradient of squared
    circumradius, gradient of volume, gradient of minimal dihedral
    angle, and random) which is better suitable to optimize their
    criterion.
-   Improved the use of cache values in `Mesh_cell_base_3` to (re)compute
    circumcenters and sliver criterion values only when needed.

### Triangulated Surface Mesh Simplification

-   Fixed a bug in the way edges can be marked as non-removable by adding
    a named-parameter `edge_is_constrained_map` to the function
    `edge_collapse`

### dD Spatial Searching

-   Fixed a documentation bug: The property map passed as template
    parameter to the classes `Search_traits_adapter` and
    `Distance_adapter` must be a lvalue property map. To avoid incorrect
    usage, a static assertion has been added in the CGAL code to prevent
    the user from instantiating these classes with an incorrect property
    map type.

### CGAL ipelets

-   Better description of the demo ipelets in the user manual
-   New ipelet for pencils of circles
-   New ipelet for hyperbolic geometry in Poincar√© model
-   The generator ipelet now generates point in a selected zone
-   Hilbert sort ipelet implements two policies
