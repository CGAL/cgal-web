<h3>Guillaume Damiand, and Clement Jamin</h3>
<h4>Liris, Lyon</h4>

<p>When you install CGAL you typically build 4 libraries, for CGAL itself, for Algebraic numbers, for Qt, and for ImageIO. As CGAL uses C++ templates these libraries are rather empty, and we work towards making them obsolete.

<p><b>Status:</b> Submitted to the Editorial Board and targeted for CGAL 4.7, Autumn 2015</p>
