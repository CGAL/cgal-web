## Changelog

### General

-   Fixed a bug that prevented the compilation with recent versions of
    Boost (&gt;=1.56) when explicit conversions operators (from C++11)
    are supported. That prevented the compilation with Microsoft Visual
    Studio 2013.

### 3D Convex Hulls

-   Fixed a non-robust predicate bug that was showing up when input points
    where lexicographically sorted.

### 3D Mesh Generation

-   Fixed a bug in the sliver perturbation optimization method. It could
    create some holes on the surface of the mesh.
