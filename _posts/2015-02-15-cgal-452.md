<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
<li> Fix a bug that prevented the compilation with recent versions of
Boost (>=1.56) when explicit conversions operators (from C++11) are
supported. That prevented the compilation with Microsoft Visual Studio
2013.
</ul>
<h3>3D Convex Hulls</h3>
<ul>
<li> Fix a non-robust predicate bug that was showing up when input
points where lexicographically sorted.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3D Mesh Generation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix a bug in the sliver perturbation optimization method. It could
create some holes on the surface of the mesh.</li>
</ul>
