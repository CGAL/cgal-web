## Changelog

### Installation

-   The required version of Boost is now 1.48 or higher.

### 2D Polyline Simplification (new package)

-   This package enables to simplify polylines with the guarantee that
    the topology of the polylines does not change. This can be done for
    a single polyline as well as for a set of polyline constraints in a
    constrained triangulation. The simplification can be controlled with
    cost and stop functions.

### 2D Generalized Barycentric Coordinates (new package)

-   This package offers an efficient and robust implementation of
    two-dimensional closed-form generalized barycentric coordinates
    defined for simple two-dimensional polygons.

### Scale-Space Surface Reconstruction (new package)

-   This new package provides a class gathering a dedicated smoothing
    algorithm and some convenience functions to help the creation of a
    surface out of a point set using the 3D Alpha Shapes package. The
    particularity of this reconstruction pipeline is that the input
    point are in the output and no new points are created. Note that in
    the current version, the output is a triangle soup that is not
    necessarily a valid (manifold) polyhedral surface.

### Surface Mesh (new package)

-   The surface mesh class provided by this package is an implementation
    of the halfedge data structure allowing to represent polyhedral
    surfaces. It is an alternative to the packages `CGAL::Polyhedron_3`
    and `CGAL::HalfedgeDS`.

### dD Triangulation (new package)

-   This new package provides classes for manipulating triangulations in
    Euclidean spaces whose dimension can be specified at compile-time or
    at run-time. It also provides a class that represents Delaunay
    triangulations.

### dD Convex Hulls and Delaunay Triangulations

-   This package is deprecated and the new package Triangulation should
    be used instead.

### dD Geometry Kernel

-   It has been reported that the recently introduced `Epick_d` kernel
    may not work with Intel C++ Compiler prior to version 15.
    Documentation has been updated.

### 3D Convex Hulls

-   Added functions `halfspace_intersection_3` and
    `halfspace_intersection_with_constructions_3` to compute the
    intersection of halfspaces defining a closed polyhedron.
-   Fixed a bug introduced in CGAL 4.5 that can appear while computing the
    convex hull of coplanar points.
-   Fixed a robustness issue in `Convex_hull_traits_3`. This traits is
    used by default with the kernel
    `Exact_predicates_inexact_constructions_kernel`.

### Combinatorial Maps and Linear Cell Complex

-   Added `correct_invalid_attributes`,
    `set_automatic_attributes_management` and
    `are_attributes_automatically_managed` methods in `CombinatorialMap`
    concept. This allows high level operations to not update non void
    attributes during massive calls of these operations, but only after
    the end of their executions.

### 2D Triangulations

-   The class `Constrained_triangulation_plus_2` now can handle
    polylines as constraints.
-   As a consequence a `Constraint_id` has been introduced which
    replaces `pair<Vertex_handle,Vertex_handle>` as identifier of a
    constraint.

### 3D Mesh Generation

-   Added member functions `output_boundary_to_off` and
    `output_facets_in_complex_to_off` in the class
    `CGAL::Mesh_complex_3_in_triangulation_3` to export the boundary of
    a domain or a subdomain.

### 3D Fast Intersection and Distance Computation

-   Added new constructors to `AABB_halfedge_graph_segment_primitive` and
    `AABB_face_graph_triangle_primitive` in order to be able to build
    primitives one by one.

### Spatial Searching

-   Fixed a bug in `CGAL::Splitters.h` sliding midpoint rule, where
    degenerated point sets (e.g.,points on segment) caused the kd-tree
    to get linear.
-   Improved performance of `Orthogonal_k_neighbor_search`. Note that VC
    2013 does not compile `boost::container::deque` of Boost 1\_55 and
    does hence have a workaround which does not have the improvement.
-   **Breaking change:** The concept `OrthogonalDistance` has new
    function overloads for `min_distance_to_rectangle` and
    `max_distance_to_rectangle` with an additional reference parameter
    `std::vector`.
-   **Breaking change:** The order of the points in the iterator range
    `[tree.begin(),tree.end()]` is not the order of insertion of the
    points into the tree. This was not guaranteed before but might have
    been observed and exploited by users.
-   Derived `kd_tree_leaf_node` and `kd_tree_internal_node` from
    `kd_tree_node` to save memory.

### Geometric Object Generators

-   Added a new function `random_convex_hull_in_disc_2` that efficiently
    generates a random polygon as the convex hull of uniform random
    points chosen in a disc.
