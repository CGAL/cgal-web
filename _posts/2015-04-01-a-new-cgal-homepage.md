<p>Already back in 2011, we tried to upgrade the CGAL website to newer technology.<p>

<p>As the reactions were devastating ("No advertisements please", "And
what if I am even to shy to sign up on Parship?"), we decided to roll
back.<p>

<p>Since then, more and more people reported that they had a hard time
with our site on their tablet or smartphone. We thought that it is
time for a fresh start using jekyll and bootstrap to offer a site
with responsive web design.<p>

<p>Besides responsiveness, we thought it is time to get a slightly cooler
look: A large image on the home page, something between <a href="http://www.airbnb.com/">airbnb</a>
and <a href="http://www.abercrombie.com/">Abercrombie&amp;Fitch</a>.</p> 

<p>What our users do, most often has a higher coolness factor than
a geometric algorithm with <em>O(n log log n)</em> amortized runtime complexity. 
We identified and contacted some users, who were willing to provide us with 
images and testimonials.
We today start our series of <em>User Portraits</em> 
with <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/news/2015/04/01/SpaceX/">SpaceX</a>. Stay tuned, even if you think
that SpaceX will be hard to beat.</p>
