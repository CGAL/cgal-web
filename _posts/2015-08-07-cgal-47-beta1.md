## Changelog

### Installation

-   The minimum required version of CMake is now 2.8.11. CMake versions
    3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 are supported.
-   All Qt4 demos have been updated and now require Qt5 to be compiled.
    Qt5 version 5.3 or higher is required. The support for Qt4 is
    dropped. To compile libCGAL\_Qt5 and demos, you must set the cmake
    or environment variable `Qt5_DIR` to point to the path to the
    directory containing the file `Qt5Config.cmake` created by your Qt5
    installation. If you are using the open source edition it should be
    `/path-to/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-<version>/qtbase/lib/cmake/Qt5`.
-   The code of the 3D demos now uses modern OpenGL, with shaders,
    instead of the fixed pipeline API of OpenGL-1.

### General

-   Support for unordered sets and maps of the stdlib and of boost for
    handle and index classes.

### L Infinity Segment Delaunay Graphs (new package)

-   The package provides the geometric traits for constructing the
    segment Delaunay graph in the max-norm (L Infinity). The traits also
    contain methods to draw the edges of the dual of the segment
    Delaunay graph in the max-norm i.e., the segment Voronoi diagram in
    the max-norm. The algorithm and traits rely on the segment Delaunay
    graph algorithm and traits under the Euclidean distance. The segment
    Voronoi diagram in the max-norm has applications in VLSI CAD.

### Advancing Front Surface Reconstruction (new package)

-   This package provides a greedy algorithm for surface reconstruction
    from an unorganized point set. Starting from a seed facet, a
    piecewise linear surface is grown by adding Delaunay triangles one
    by one. The most plausible triangles are added first, in a way that
    avoids the appearance of topological singularities.

### Triangulated Surface Mesh Shortest Paths (new package)

-   The package provides methods for computing shortest path on
    triangulated surface meshes. Given a set of source points on the
    surface, this package provides a data structure that can efficiently
    provides the shortest path from any point on the surface to the
    sources points. There is no restriction on the genus or the number
    of connected components of the mesh.

### Triangulated Surface Mesh Skeletonization (new package)

-   This package provides a (1D) curve skeleton extraction algorithm for
    a triangulated polygonal mesh without borders based on the mean
    curvature flow. The particularity of this skeleton is that it
    captures the topology of the input. For each skeleton vertex one can
    obtain its location and its corresponding vertices from the input
    mesh. The code is generic and works with any model of the
    \`FaceListGraph\` concept.

### 3D Point-Set Shape Detection (new package)

-   This package implements the efficient RANSAC method for shape
    detection, contributed by Schnabel et al. From an unstructured point
    set with unoriented normals, the algorithm detects a set of shapes.
    Five types of primitive shapes are provided by this package: plane,
    sphere, cylinder, cone and torus. Detecting other types of shapes is
    possible by implementing a class derived from a base shape.

### 2D Visibility (new package)

-   This package provides several variants to compute the visibility
    area of a point within polygonal regions in two dimensions.

### Polygon Mesh Processing (new package)

-   This package implements a collection of methods and classes for
    polygon mesh processing, ranging from basic operations on simplices,
    to complex geometry processing algorithms. The implementation of
    this package mainly follows algorithms and references given in
    Botsch et al.'s book on polygon mesh processing.

### Approximation of Ridges and Umbilics on Triangulated Surface Meshes

-   This package now supports any model of the concept `FaceGraph`.
-   **Breaking change:** The package no longer supports models of
    `TriangulatedSurfaceMesh` which are not at the same time models of
    the concept `FaceGraph`.
### dD Geometry Kernel

-   Epick\_d gains 3 new functors: `Construct_circumcenter_d`,
    `Compute_squared_radius_d`, `Side_of_bounded_sphere_d`. Those are
    essential for the computation of alpha-shapes.

### 2D Arrangements

-   Introduced a new traits class, called
    `Arr_polycurve_traits_2<SubcurveTraits>`, which handles general
    piece-wise (polycurve) curves. The pieces do not necessarily have to
    be linear.
-   Introduced two new concepts called `ArrangementApproximateTraits_2`
    and `ArrangementConstructXMonotoneCurveTraits_2`.
-   The existing `ArrangementLandmarkTraits_2` concept, which has
    two requirements, now refines the two respective concepts above.
-   The template parameter of the existing
    `Arr_polyline_traits_2<SegmentTraits>` template must be
    substituted with a traits class that is a model of the
    `ArrangementConstructXMonotoneTraits_2` concept among the other
    when `Arr_polyline_traits_2` is instantiated.

### 2D Minkowski Sums

-   Added support for polygons with holes and optimized the construction
    of Minkowski sums.
-   Introduced an implementation of the "reduced convolution"
    method, a variant of the method described in "2D Minkowski Sum
    of Polygons Using Reduced Convolution" by Behar and Lien. The
    new method supports polygons with holes and in many cases out
    pergorms the implementation of the exsisting (full) convolution
    method.
-   Introduced two new classes that decompose polygons into convex
    pieces (models of the `PolygonConvexDecomposition_2` concept)
    based on vertical decomposition and constrained Delaunay
    triangulation, respectively. These new models also support the
    convex decomposition of polygons with holes.

### 3D Periodic Triangulations

-   Renamed `Periodic_3_triangulation_traits_3` to
    `Periodic_3_Delaunay_triangulation_traits_3`.
-   Renamed the concept `Periodic_3TriangulationTraits_3` to
    `Periodic_3DelaunayTriangulationTraits_3`.
-   Created `Periodic_3_triangulation_traits_3` and the concept
    `Periodic_3TriangulationTraits_3`.

### 2D Conforming Triangulations and Meshes

-   Added an optimization method `CGAL::lloyd_optimize_mesh_2()` that
    implements the Lloyd (or Centroidal Voronoi Tesselation)
    optimization algorithm in a Constrained Delaunay Triangulation. For
    optimization, the triangulation data structure on which the mesher
    relies needs its `VertexBase` template parameter to be a model of
    the new concept `DelaunayMeshVertexBase_2`.

### Point Set Processing and Surface Reconstruction from Point Sets

-   Added the function `CGAL::compute_vcm()` for computing the Voronoi
    Covariance Measure (VCM) of a point set. The output of this function
    can be used with the function `CGAL::vcm_is_on_feature_edge()` to
    determine whether a point is on or close to a feature edge. The
    former function is also internally used by
    `CGAL::vcm_estimate_normals()` to estimate the normals of a point
    set and it is particularly suited to point sets with noise.

### Spatial Sorting

-   Added the possibility to sort points on a sphere along a space-filling
    curve using the functions `CGAL::hilbert_sort_on_sphere` and
    `CGAL::spatial_sort_on_sphere`.

### Geometric Object Generators

-   Added new random generator of points in a 2D and 3D triangle and in a
    tetrahedron (`CGAL::Random_points_in_triangle_2`,
    `CGAL::Random_points_in_triangle_3`,
    `CGAL::Random_points_in_tetrahedron_3`).
