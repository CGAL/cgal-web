<div class="product-detail-info" markdown="1">

## Changelog

### General

-   The support for Qt3 is dropped and all demos using it have been removed.

### Installation

-   Starting with Visual C++ 2015 we no longer require `Boost.Thread` as
    we use the C++11 keyword `thread_local` and the C+11 class
    `std::mutex` .
-   The same holds for g++ 4.8 or later when the C++11 standard is used.

### 2D Reconstruction and Simplification from Point Set (new package)

-   This package implements a method to reconstruct and simplify 2D
    point sets. The input is a set of 2D points with mass attributes,
    possibly hampered by noise and outliers. The output is a set of line
    segments and isolated points which approximate the input points.

### 2D Regularized Boolean Set-Operations

-   Improved the performance of operations in some settings.
    **Breaking change**: This improvement requires changes of the face
    and halfedge type of the underlying arrangement Dcel. See the
    concepts `GeneralPolygonSetDcelHalfedge` and
    `GeneralPolygonSetDcelFace` for more details. If you use a different
    simplex types, inheriting your simplices from `CGAL::Gps_face_base`
    and `CGAL::Gps_halfedge_base` is sufficient to accommodate for the
    update.

### 3D Boolean Operations on Nef Polyhedra

-   Added 3 new constructors: from a point range, from a point, and from a
    segment.

### Combinatorial Maps

-   **Breaking change**: Changed the type of Boolean marks, old type is
    int, new type is `size_type`. If no more mark is available,
    `get_new_mark` throws an exception, instead of returning `-1`.

### 2D Arrangements

-   Sped up the edge removal in case the incident faces contains many
    holes.

### 3D Mesh Generation

-   Added support of 3D gray level images as input for the tetrahedral
    mesh generation.
-   **Breaking change:** All models of the concept `MeshDomain_3` must
    now provide a member function `bbox()`.

### Advancing Front Surface Reconstruction

-   Optional template functor `Filter` is replaced by another optional
    template functor `Priority`. This allows to change the way facets
    are prioritized by the algorithm instead of having a simple option
    to reject some facets.
    **Breaking change**: Programs using the old `Filter` API will not
    compile anymore as it must be replaced with the `Priority` API as
    described in the manual. Codes using the default behavior are not
    impacted.

### Polygon Mesh Processing

-   Added a new triangle-based isotropic remeshing algorithm for
    triangulated surface meshes,
    `CGAL::Polygon_mesh_processing::isotropic_remeshing()` and a helper
    function for isotropic remeshing :
    `CGAL::Polygon_mesh_processing::split_long_edges()`
-   Added the function `CGAL::Polygon_mesh_processing::border_halfedges()`
    to collect the border of a given face range
-   Added the function
    `CGAL::Polygon_mesh_processing::remove_isolated_vertices()` to be
    used on any polygon mesh
-   Added the function `CGAL::Polygon_mesh_processing::triangulate_face()`
    to triangulate a single face of a polygon mesh
-   Added an overload for
    `CGAL::Polygon_mesh_processing::triangulate_faces()` to triangulate
    a range of faces of a polygon mesh
-   Added function `keep_large_connected_components()`
-   Added measuring functions for polygon meshes, to compute length, area,
    and volume of simplices or group of simplices of a polygon mesh.
-   Added function `bbox_3()` to compute the bounding box of a polygon
    mesh.

### Surface Mesh Parameterization

-   `LSCM_parameterizer_3` now uses by default Eigen instead of OpenNL
    as a model of `SparseLinearAlgebraTraits_d`.

### Point Set Processing

-   **Breaking change:** new template parameter `Concurrency_tag` for
    the functions `compute_average_spacing()`,
    `edge_aware_upsample_point_set()`, `jet_estimate_normals()`,
    `jet_smooth_point_set()`, and `pca_estimate_normals()`. To update
    your code simply add as first template parameter
    `CGAL::Sequential_tag` or `CGAL::Parallel_tag` when calling one of
    these functions.
-   `CGAL::Parallel_tag` can no longer be used in Point Set Processing
    algorithms if TBB is not available.
-   Added a new simplification algorithm based on hierarchical clustering:
    `CGAL::hierarchy_simplify_point_set()`. It allows either to
    uniformly simplify the point set or to automatically adapt the local
    density of points to the local variation of the input computed by
    principal component analysis.
-   New IO functions for PLY format (Polygon File Format):
    `CGAL::read_ply_points()`, `CGAL::read_ply_points_and_normals()`,
    `CGAL::write_ply_points()` and
    `CGAL::write_ply_points_and_normals()`.

### Spatial Searching

-   Added function to find any point in a range query, that is neither all
    points, nor the closest one.

### Principal Component Analysis

-   Added a template parameter `DiagonalizeTraits` for functions
    `CGAL::linear_least_squares_fitting_2()` and
    `CGAL::linear_least_squares_fitting_3()`. This allows to either
    choose the legacy internal diagonalization code from CGAL or the
    Eigen implementation (or any class that is a model of
    `DiagonalizeTraits`). Variants of the function that automatically
    deduce the kernel also automatically select the diagonalizer, so the
    API is mostly preserved.

### CGAL and Solvers

-   This package now includes all CGAL concepts for solvers with models
    using the third party Eigen library.

### CGAL and the Boost Graph Library (BGL)

-   Added function `CGAL::split_graph_into_polylines()` that allows to
    extract from a soup of segments given as a graph, polylines with
    nodes of degree at most 2. In addition a functor can be passed to
    the function to specify additional polyline endpoints.
-   New functions to manipulate selection of faces, edges and vertices
    in a halfedge graph are added: `CGAL::expand_face_selection()`,
    `CGAL::reduce_face_selection()`, `CGAL::expand_edge_selection()`,
    `CGAL::reduce_edge_selection()` `CGAL::expand_vertex_selection()`,
    `CGAL::reduce_vertex_selection()` and
    `CGAL::select_incident_faces()`.
-   Added a helper function `CGAL::clear` which clears a MutableFaceGraph
    efficiently and generically.
