## Changelog

### Header-only mode

-   CGAL can now be used in headers only mode, i.e. without compiling
    the CGAL libraries and linking with these libraries when compiling
    examples, tests and demos. Note that running CMake on CGAL is still
    required in order to generate some configuration files.

### Cone Based Spanners (new package)

-   This package provides algorithms for constructing two kinds of
    cone-based spanners: Yao graph and Theta graph, given a set of
    vertices on the plane and the directions of cone boundaries.

### 2D Minkowski Sums

-   Introduced a convex decomposition strategy, namely
    `Polygon_nop_decomposition_2`, that merely passed the input polygon
    to the list of output polygons.
-   Introduced overloads of the function `minkowski_sum_2()`, which
    accepts 2 decomposition strategies.
-   Introduced an overloaded function called
    `minkowski_sum_by_decomposition_2(P, Q, decom_no_holes,     decomp_with_holes)`,
    which computes the 2D Minkowski sum using optimal choices of
    decomposition strategies.

### Combinatorial Maps

-   Deprecated global functions (`make_combinatorial_hexahedron()`,
    `make_combinatorial_polygon()`, `make_combinatorial_tetrahedron()`,
    `make_edge()`, `insert_cell_0_in_cell_1()`,
    `insert_cell_0_in_cell_2()`, `insert_cell_1_in_cell_2()`,
    `insert_cell_2_in_cell_3()`, `insert_dangling_cell_1_in_cell_2()`,
    `is_insertable_cell_1_in_cell_2()`,
    `is_insertable_cell_2_in_cell_3()`, `is_removable()`,
    `remove_cell()`) which are now member functions in the
    `CombinatorialMap` concept.
-   It is not longer possible to use the old API switched on by defining
    the macro `CGAL_CMAP_DEPRECATED`. This API was deprecated since CGAL
    4.4.

### Point Set Processing

-   New function `CGAL::read_ply_custom_points()` that allows the user
    to read any additional point attribute from a PLY input point set.
-   `CGAL::structure_point_set()`: new algorithm that takes advantage of
    detected planes to produce a structured point set (with flat
    regions, sharp edges and vertices).

### Point Set Shape Detection

-   New post-processing algorithm: `CGAL::regularize_planes()`. This
    allows the user to favor parallelism, orthogonality, coplanarity
    and/or axial symmetry between detected planes.

### Polygon Mesh Processing

-   Added the function
    `CGAL::Polygon_mesh_processing::is_polygon_soup_a_polygon_mesh()` to
    check whether a polygon soup is a polygon mesh.
-   Added some new features to `CGAL::isotropic_remeshing()`:
    -   It is now possible to select fixed vertices that survive the
        remeshing process, and to keep face attributes such as colors
        valid after remeshing.
    -   The user can choose the number of relaxation steps happening at
        each loop, and to run 1-dimensional relaxation along constrained
        polylines.
-   The functions `CGAL::Polygon_mesh_processing::triangulate_face()`
    and `CGAL::Polygon_mesh_processing::triangulate_faces()` now
    indicate whether some faces have not been triangulated.

### Surface Mesh Deformation

-   Added a new tag `SRE_ARAP` to use the Smoothed Rotation Enhanced
    As-Rigid-As-Possible deformation algorithm.

### 3D Fast Intersection and Distance Computation

-   Added the functions `AABB_tree::first_intersection()` and
    `AABB_tree::first_intersected_primitive()` that compute the
    intersection which is closest to the source of a ray

### CGAL and the Boost Graph Library (BGL)

-   Added a helper function `CGAL::copy_face_graph()` to copy a source
    FaceListGraph into another FaceListGraph of different type.
-   Added a class `CGAL::Dual` that creates the dual view of a `FaceGraph`
    and a creation function `CGAL::dual(primal)`.

#### CGAL and Boost Property Maps

-   It is not longer possible to use the old API of the property maps
    provided by CGAL, switched on by defining the macro
    `CGAL_USE_PROPERTY_MAPS_API_V1`. This API was deprecated since CGAL
    4.3.
