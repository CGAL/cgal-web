As in the previous years the CGAL Project has a booth on the
exhibition floor at Siggraph.

This is the opportunity to see what is new, to discuss how you
might contribute a result of your research, to learn about what
we do as participant at the Google Summer of Code, to discuss
licensing, to tell us what you like about CGAL and what you hate,
or what algorithm you would like to see in the future.


Visit the CGAL Project on Booth No. 1039 at the exhibition of <a href="http://s2018.siggraph.org/">Siggraph 2018</a>,
Vancouver Canada, 12-18 August 2017.
