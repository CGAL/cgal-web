As last the year the CGAL Project has a booth on the
exhibition floor at INTERGEO.  We go there as we realized that we have
a quite big user community in this application area.


This is the opportunity to see what is new, to discuss how you
might contribute a result of your research related to geospatial applications, to discuss
open source as well as commercial licensing, to tell us what you like about CGAL and what you hate,
or what algorithm you would like to see in the future in the CGAL library.

Visit the CGAL Project on Booth No. 12.1C.091 at the exhibition of <a href="https://www.intergeo.de/intergeo-en/trade-fair.php">INTERGEO 2018</a>,
Vancouver Canada, 12-18 August 2017.
