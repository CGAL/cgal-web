The so called "Optimal Area Polygonalization" problem was presented as a challenge at SoCG 20; see the [contest webpage](https://cgshop.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/). We used CGAL extensively in our implementation; see the [project webpage](http://acg.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/in-house-projects/optimal-area-polygonalization/optimal-area-polygonalization). Our team was awarded 3rd place.
