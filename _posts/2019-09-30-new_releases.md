The CGAL Open Source Project is pleased to announce today three new
releases:

  * [CGAL-4.13.2](../cgal4132) is the second (and last) bug-fix release for CGAL-4.13,
  * [CGAL-4.14.1](../cgal4141) is the first bug-fix release for CGAL-4.14,
  * and [CGAL-5.0-beta1](../cgal50-beta1) is the first beta release for CGAL-5.0.

CGAL 5.0 is the first release of CGAL that requires a C++ compiler
with the support of C++14 or later. The new list of supported
compilers is:

  -   Visual C++ 14.0 (from Visual Studio 2015 Update 3) or later,
  -   Gnu g++ 6.3 or later (on Linux or MacOS),
  -   LLVM Clang version 8.0 or later (on Linux or MacOS), and
  -   Apple Clang compiler versions 7.0.2 and 10.0.1 (on MacOS).

Users with environments that do not allow the use of C++14 must use
CGAL-4.14 and its bug-fix releases.
