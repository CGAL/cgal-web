<p>Bayer, is a German multinational corporation that in 2018 acquired
Monsanto, an American agrochemical and agricultural biotechnology corporation,
now <em>Bayer CropScience</em>.</p>

<h3>Computer Science meets Crop Science</h3>

<p>In order to <a href="https://www.cropscience.bayer.com/">challenge the impossible</a>, Bayer CropScience has
built a strong multi-disciplinary R&D group with biologist, physicists, chemists,
anthropologists,  and, last but not least, computer scientists.
In order to provide enough food for an ever growing world population,
they work towards new high yield plants, and on replicants of bees
needed for pollination -- bees are on the red list of endangered species as a consequence of global warming.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the 20th Century we fought nature with products like Roundup, in the 21th Century we go with the flow.</p>
<p><small>Tobo Mitsubachi, R&D director Bayer CropScience, Japan</small></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the strategy of the typical robotics researcher, for example at <a href="https://smartfarmingconference.com/speaker/apis-pollinator-drone-presented-anthony-van-der-pluijm-aleksandar-petrov-delft-university-technology/">Delft University</a>, is to miniaturize classical drones, Bayer CropScience decided to go the other way round,
that is, bottom up, right from the animal, replacing as little as possible in a proven design that
is the result of thousands of years of evolution.</p>

<p>As the flight mechanics of dragon flies is better understood than the flight mechanics of bees,
let alone bumble bees, Bayer CropScienc opted for 3D printing dragon flies.  As insect wings are far beyond what
can be additively manufactured in 2020, they only print the body and combine it 
with organic wings, which get harvested from natural dragon flies.  The printed body hosts minimalistic sensor technology,
a Raspberry Epsilon, which is the low energy model of the well known Raspberry Pi,
and biodegradable battery technology, all printed in a single sweep, with only the organic wings
attached in a final assembly step.</p>


<h3>Tell Me Where the Flowers Are</h3>

<p>As in most products where CGAL components are used, CGAL provides only a small piece of functionality
in a big technological puzzle.  The pollinating dragon flies land
on the infrared spot that each clover flower represents in an otherwise gray world. "Seeing" this spot
is camera and image processing technology. But this gray world has major obstacles to avoid, namely
grass blades, plant stems and pedicels sticking out, and that is where CGAL comes in. The AI based collision avoidance
algorithm has geometry neurons (TM) which perform segment stabbing queries using the CGAL
<a href="https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/packages.html#PkgAABBTree">Axis Aligned Bounding Box Tree</a>.
This CGAL data structure works out of the box, but in order to achieve real time performance,
we had to rewrite the parallelism based on TBB, as Intel does not yet support the Raspberry Epsilon.</p>

<h3>Small is Beautiful</h3>

<p>Bayer CropScience not only picks the best technologies available worldwide, 
but it also does not limit itself to doing joint research with
Ivy League universities, as did Monsanto which finally led to the Roundup disaster.
Monsanto suffered from the NIH problem and a national preference for research collaborations.
Futhermore, Bayer CropScience has a technology scout team that identifies high potential small and medium enterprises
which are capable to provide solutions and which do not make it on the radar of Bayer's competitors.<p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It is amazing what you can get from European SMEs nowadays. 
<a href="https://www.geometryfactory.com">GeometryFactory</a>, based in the French Silicon Valley,
did an incredible job when they turned the AABB Tree, developed at Inria
(<em>Inventeurs du Monde numerique</em>), into an industry strong product, and even got it running on a  Raspberry epsilon. And we didn't believe our eyes when we saw the first flying dragon produced by the, Grenoble based, company <a href="http://www.microlight.fr/applications.html">Microlight3D</a>, which is specialized in microprinting."</p>
