<h3>Tetrahedral Isotropic Remeshing</h3>

<p>This new package implements the uniform version of the
<a href="https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/boubek/papers/MADVolumeRemesher/">Multi-Material Adaptive Volume Remesher</a>
algorithm described by Noura Faraj et al. for quality tetrahedral remeshing. This practical iterative remeshing algorithm
is designed to remesh multi-material tetrahedral meshes, by iteratively performing a sequence of elementary operations
such as edge splits, edge collapses, edge flips, and vertex relocations following a Laplacian smoothing.
The algorithm results in high-quality uniform isotropic meshes, with the user-defined uniform sizing field,
while preserving the materials, the input geometric curve and surface features, and the topology of the feature complex.</p>

<small><b>Left:</b> Tetrahedral mesh generated by CGAL's tetrahedral mesh generation algorithm. Dihedral angles are in [12, 162].
            <b>Middle:</b> The same mesh after remeshing with the same size parameter. Dihedral angles are in [17.7, 149].
            <b>Right:</b> The same mesh after remeshing with an as coarse as possible size parameter. Dihedral angles are in [45, 95].</small>
</div>

<br>Several options are available to tune the remeshing process for the user's needs :

- remesh only a subregion of the mesh,
- remesh or preserve the input surfaces and feature polylines,
- preserve a set of facets and a set of edges from being remeshed,
- perform smoothing on feature polylines.

<p>See <a href="https://cgal.geometryfactory.com/CGAL/doc/master/Tetrahedral_remeshing/group__PkgTetrahedralRemeshingRef.html#gae4686577872290e0335439edafb27a7b">CGAL::tetrahedral_isotropic_remeshing()</a> for the complete API and list of options.

<h3>Improve a Tetrahedral Mesh Quality</h3>
<p>
Tetrahedral mesh generation can lead to over-refinement in some undesired places, e.g. where geometry is a thin volume and/or a polyline
incident to sharp dihedral angles formed by the surface.
Tetrahedral remeshing fixes those over-refinements while keeping the geometry and topology of the feature complex.</p>

<h3>CGAL</h3>
<p>The package <em>Tetrahedral Remeshing</em> is already integrated in CGAL's master branch
on the <a href="https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/">CGAL GitHub repository</a>, and will be
officially released in the upcoming version of CGAL, CGAL 5.1, scheduled for September 2020.</p>
