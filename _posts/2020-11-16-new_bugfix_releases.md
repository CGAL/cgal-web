The CGAL Open Source Project is pleased to announce today two new releases:

  * [CGAL-5.0.4](/2020/11/16/cgal504) is the fourth (and last) bug-fix release for CGAL-5.0, and
  * [CGAL-5.1.1](/2020/11/16/cgal511) is the first bug-fix release for CGAL-5.1.

The first beta release of CGAL-5.2 (CGAL-5.2-beta1) is planned for this week. The development of CGAL will then focus on the future CGAL-5.3 (planned for June 2021), with bug-fixes regularly backported to the branches for CGAL-5.1.x and CGAL-5.2.
