<p>You probably wouldn't have imagined that <em>Alpha Exploration</em>, which runs
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1503133294">Clubhouse</a>, is a user of CGAL.
You can learn all about how Alpha Exploration and other companies use it in our
Clubhouse room "Geometry meets Industry".</p>


<h3>The Room</h3>

<p>This room is hosted by cgal.org and we have invited a handful of industrial CGAL users.
We do not have CEOs as guests, but a lineup of six VPs of Engineering who are dealing with geometric
computing on an every day basis. They work in the application areas of autonomous cars,
animation, health care, defense, web mapping, and social networks. You will be amazed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Geometry without images?!" you may think, but you will understand quickly that to see
is not always that important. Lean back, close your eyes, and imagine a triangle...</p>
 <p><small>Rohan Seth, CTO of Alpha Exploration</small></p>

<p>In case you are already a Clubhouse Member just join us on Sunday 18th of April at 6:00pm Paris time.</p>


<h3>Talk Your Way Past the Bouncer</h3>

<p>In case you are not a member, nothing is lost yet.   As a host, cgal.org has a quota
of hundred invitations to hand out, twenty of them with an open mic, that is you get the chance
to raise hand and interact with our guests.</p>

<p>To apply, please drop a mail at
<a href="mailto:clubhouse@cgal.org?subject=Please%20let%20me%20in">clubhouse@cgal.org</a>,
and let us know if you want to listen or speak.
Don't send us your CV, but also more than just your email address - after all we have to make a
choice. What are your achievements? What burning question do you have? Or whatever you can imagine
to convince us to pick you. We will strive for a mixed audience, and only for those of you  who want to speak,
we will organize a short interview to hear if you really come across.</p>
