The CGAL Open Source Project is pleased to announce today two new releases:

  * [CGAL-5.1.4](/2021/06/02/cgal514) is the fourth (and last) bug-fix release for CGAL-5.1, and
  * [CGAL-5.2.2](/2021/06/02/cgal522) is the second bug-fix release for CGAL-5.2.

The first beta release of CGAL-5.3 (CGAL-5.3-beta1) is planned for this week. The development of CGAL will then focus on the future CGAL-5.4 (planned for December 2021), with bug-fixes regularly backported to the branches for CGAL-5.2.x and CGAL-5.3.x.
