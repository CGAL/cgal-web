The CGAL Open Source Project is pleased to announce two new releases that were publish last Friday:

  * [CGAL-5.4.2](/2022/07/15/cgal5.4.2) is the second bug-fix release for CGAL-5.4, and
  * [CGAL-5.5](/2022/07/15/cgal55) is the most recent feature release of CGAL.

The development of CGAL will now focus on the future CGAL-5.6 (planned for December 2022), with bug-fixes regularly backported to the branches for CGAL-5.4.x and CGAL-5.5.x.
