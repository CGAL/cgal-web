The CGAL Open Source Project is pleased to announce two new releases:

  * [CGAL-5.4.3](/2022/10/12/cgal5.4.3) is the third bug-fix release for CGAL-5.4, and
  * [CGAL-5.5.1](/2022/10/12/cgal551) is the first bug-fix release for CGAL-5.5.

The development of CGAL is still focused on the future CGAL-5.6 (now planned for June 2023), with bug-fixes regularly backported to the branches for CGAL-5.4.x and CGAL-5.5.x.
