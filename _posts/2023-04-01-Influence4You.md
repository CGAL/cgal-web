<p>Although the CGAL Open Source Project is a non-profit organization it
should be clear that we need communication to reach new users and grow
the community. Today <I>Influencer Marketing</I> is the channel of choice.</p>

<h3>Communication Theory</h3>

<p>Last century only big players had one page advertisements in
traditional print media, that is newspapers like the New York Times and
weekly publications like The Economist. Smaller software companies
advertised in niche publications like <a
href="https://www.usinenouvelle.com/">Usine Nouvelle</a> or
01-Informatique. At the end of the century you saw the arrival of
featured content, that is articles written by journalists paid by
companies, as well as industry fair magazines such as <a
href="https://formnext.mesago.com/frankfurt/en/themes-events/fonmag/fonmag_archive.html">fon</a>.</p>

<p>Other old fashioned ways to advertise are electronic billboards. While a
brand like Pepsi or Nike can afford a permanent screening, we paid
for a <I>focused screening</I> that is 30 minutes during the social
event of a conference.<p>

<p>October 23, 2000, will be a date forever remembered by internet
marketers around the globe, as this was the birth of the first ever
self-serve online advertising platform – Google AdWords.
The CGAL Project since ever spent a small budget on keywords like
"Minkowski Sum" and "Hausdorff Distance".</p>

<p>We also invest in <I>Banner Ads<I> at conferences like Siggraph,
InterGEO (geographical information systems) and FormNext (additive
manufacturing). While at Siggraph the goal is to show presence to the
many attendees who know us already, for the other conferences the goal
is to make people curious and actively search -- "CGAL, What
might that stand for?".</p>

<p>We are not very active on the CGAL youtube channel which is a pity as geometric
computing is very visual, and we are only a little
bit more active on our <a href="https://twitter.com/TheCGALProject">twitter feed</a>,
but not comparable to some individuals in the geometry processing community
who communicate on each lemma of each publication and on each implementation detail
of their own code.</p>

<p> Last but not least, we have the list of <a
href="https://www.cgal.org/projects.html">Projects Using CGAL</a>
which brings us to the heart of this posting. Most people find this
long list of real world users a good argument to have a closer look at CGAL.
Humans trust other humans who made a positive experience and
who are independent from the self-praising tweets, from paid-for-content,
and without paid-for-phantastically-rendered magazine images. Real world users are
trustworthy <I>Influencers<I>.</p>

<H3>Influencers</H3>

<p>We are glad that you did not stop reading when this ugly word popped up -- influencer. Most of you are
scientists, you are objective. There must be hard facts, and it needs more than a
good looking teenager telling you that a particular beauty product makes you still more beautiful,
or a pimple-speckled nerd telling you that Blender is great. Quite similar to Churchill's
"Democracy is the worst form of government – except for all the others that have been tried.",
<I>Influencer Marketing</I>  is by large the most honest way of advertising.</p>


<p>The CGAL Project is customer of <a
href="https://www.influence4you.com/en">Influence4You</a> the ultimate
platform for matchmaking of organizations and influencers. Without
going into details this platform is an efficient lever pretty much
like github and github co-pilot is the lever in the world of
programming. The hiccup is that we only found few influencers who are
knowledgeable in geometry processing and it would be good if that
changed -- not only for the CGAL Project, but for many products (yet
another "ugly" word) who got the SGP Software Award, to name just a
few.<p>


<h3>Just Do It</h3>

<p>To those of you who have blogs and twitter accounts, you should have a look at
Influence4You.  Admit that you like a big number of readers and subscribers, not
because you are selfish, but because you know that your opinion counts and you want
to have maximum impact.</p>

<p>To those of you who have expertise and strong opinions, but not motivated
to setup WordPress or create a twitter account, plus the awareness that the first
three months with less than hundred followers are a humiliating experience,
note that Influence4You provides the means to get a flying start.</p>
