<p>Although the CGAL Open Source Project is a non-profit organization, it
should be clear that we need communication to reach new users and grow
the community. Today <I>Influencer Marketing</I> is the channel of choice.</p>

<br>
<h3>Communication Theory</h3>

<p>Last century, only big players had one-page advertisements in
traditional print media, that is newspapers like the New York Times and
weekly publications like The Economist. Smaller software companies
advertised in niche publications like <a
href="https://www.usinenouvelle.com/">Usine Nouvelle</a> or
01-Informatique. The end of the century saw the arrival of
featured content, that is articles written by journalists paid by
companies, as well as industry fair magazines such as <a
href="https://formnext.mesago.com/frankfurt/en/themes-events/fonmag/fonmag_archive.html">fon</a>.</p>

<p>Other old fashioned ways to advertise are electronic billboards. While a
brand like Pepsi or Nike can afford a permanent screening, we could only pay
for a <I>focused screening</I> of 30 minutes during the social event of a recent conference.<p>

<br>
<p>October 23, 2000, will be a date forever remembered by internet
marketers around the globe as this was the birth of the first ever
self-serve online advertising platform: Google AdWords.
The CGAL Project has since then spent a small budget on keywords like
"Apollonius Graphs" and "Periodic Hyperbolic Triangulations".</p>

<p>We also invest in <I>Banner Ads</I> at conferences like Siggraph,
InterGEO (geographical information systems), and FormNext (additive
manufacturing). While at Siggraph the goal is to show presence to the
many attendees who know us already, for the other conferences the goal
is to make people curious and actively search -- "CGAL, What
might that stand for?".</p>

<p>There are however other channels where we are not performing as we should: we are
not very active on the CGAL youtube channel (which is a pity as geometric
computing is very visual), and we are only a little
bit more active on our <a href="https://twitter.com/TheCGALProject">twitter feed</a>,
but we should strive to communicate as the top: on each lemma of a publication,
and on each implementation detail.</p>

<p> Last but not least, we keep a list of <a
href="https://www.cgal.org/projects.html">Projects Using CGAL</a>,
which brings us to the heart of this posting. Most people find this
long list of real-world users a good argument to have a closer look at CGAL.
Humans trust other humans who have had a positive experience and
who are independent from the self-praising tweets and paid-for content
with paid-for-phantastically-rendered magazine images. In other words,
real-world users are trustworthy <I>Influencers</I>.</p>

<br>
<H3>Influencers</H3>

<p>We are glad that you did not stop reading when this ugly word popped up -- influencer. Most of you are
scientists, and thus you are objective. There must be hard facts, and it needs more than a
good looking teenager telling you that a particular beauty product makes you still more beautiful,
or a pimple-speckled nerd telling you that Blender is great. Quite similar to Churchill's
"Democracy is the worst form of government â€“ except for all the others that have been tried.",
<I>Influencer Marketing</I> is by large the most honest way of advertising, which is why
we have embraced it.</p>

<p>Indeed, the CGAL Project is now a customer of <a
href="https://www.influence4you.com/en">Influence4You</a>, the ultimate
platform for matchmaking organizations and influencers. Without
going into details, this platform is an efficient lever, pretty much
like Github co-pilot is the lever in the world of programming.
The hiccup is that we have only found few influencers on the platform that are
knowledgeable in geometry processing. It would be good if that
changed, not only for the CGAL Project, but for many products (yet
another "ugly" word) who got the SGP Software Award, to name just a few.<p>

<br>
<h3>Just Do It</h3>

<p>To those of you who have blogs and twitter accounts, you should have a look at
Influence4You. Admit that you like a big number of readers and subscribers, not
because you are selfish, but because you know that your opinion counts and you want
to have maximum impact.</p>

<p>To those of you who have expertise and strong opinions, but are not motivated
to setup WordPress or to create a twitter account, or wish to avoid the humiliating experience
of having fewer than a hundred followers in the beginning, note that Influence4You
provides the means to get a flying start.</p>

With this new venture, CGAL is embracing both traditional and modern venues,
and will look forward to the future.
