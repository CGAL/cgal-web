The CGAL Open Source Project is pleased to announce today three new releases:

  * [CGAL-5.4.5](/2023/07/28/cgal5.4.5) is the fifth and last bug-fix release for CGAL-5.4,
  * [CGAL-5.5.3](/2023/07/28/cgal553) is the third bug-fix release for CGAL-5.5, and
  * [CGAL-5.6](/2023/07/28/cgal56) is latest release of CGAL.

The development of CGAL will now focus on the future CGAL-6.0 (planned for June 2024), with bug-fixes
regularly backported to the branches for CGAL-5.5.x and CGAL-5.6.x. CGAL-6.0 will be the first release
of CGAL requiring C++17 or later. It will also support Qt6.
