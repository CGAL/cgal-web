The CGAL Open Source Project is pleased to announce new CGAL versions that were published recently.

### CGAL version 6.0

CGAL version [6.0] was published on September 27, 2024. After bugs were detected early, version [6.0.1] was published on October 22, 2024.

This version is a major release, with many new features and improvements.

#### General changes

- **C++17 Requirement**: CGAL 6.0 requires a C++17 compatible compiler.
- **GMP/MPFR Optional**: GMP/MPFR are no longer mandatory; Boost.Multiprecision can be used.
- **Qt6 Demos**: All demos are now based on Qt6.
- **Polyhedral Surface**: Demo renamed to "CGAL Lab" and moved to its own directory in `demo/Lab/`.

#### New Packages

- **[Kinetic Space Partition](https://doc.cgal.org/6.0.1/Manual/packages.html#PkgKineticSpacePartition)**: Partition of the space from planar input shapes.
- **[Kinetic Surface Reconstruction](https://doc.cgal.org/6.0.1/Manual/packages.html#PkgKineticSurfaceReconstruction)**: Reconstructs surfaces from point clouds.
- **[Basic Viewer](https://doc.cgal.org/6.0.1/Basic_viewer/index.html#Chapter_Basic_viewer)**: Interactive visualization for various CGAL packages.
- **[Polygon Repair](https://doc.cgal.org/6.0.1/Manual/packages.html#PkgPolygonRepair)**: Algorithms to repair 2D polygons and multipolygons.

#### Breaking Changes

- **CMake Changes**: `UseCGAL.cmake` removed; use `CGAL::CGAL` target instead.
- **Kernel**: Replaced `boost::variant` with `std::variant` and `boost::optional` with `std::optional` in the intersection functions.

#### Enhancements

- **AABB Tree**: Now supports 2D and 3D primitives.

See the [announcement of CGAL version 6.0.1][6.0.1] for more details.

### Bug-fix releases

- [CGAL version 5.5.5][5.5.5] has been published. This is the last bug-fix release for CGAL-5.5.
- [CGAL version 5.6.2][5.6.2] has been published. This is the second bug-fix release for CGAL-5.6.

The development of CGAL will now focus on the future CGAL-6.1 (planned for late 2025), with bug-fixes regularly backported to the branches for CGAL-5.6.x and CGAL-5.5.x.
