<p>The De Beers Group is a South Africanâ€“British corporation that specializes in the diamond industry,
including mining, exploitation, retail, inscription, grading, trading and industrial diamond manufacturing.
Tiffany and Co. is an American luxury jewelry and specialty design house headquartered on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.</p>

<p>Just like Total and Saudi Aramco, the De Beers Group has been making use of the
fantastic CGAL mesh generation algorithms in their sub-surface modeling software for several years already.
More recently, we worked on a completely different topic for them, when they needed a highest
performance version for the corefinement of a mesh with a plane (See pull request
<a href="https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/pull/8721">PR 8721</a>) for a rather special
diamond cut project, called "Hope". Before cutting a real raw diamond, they explore
the space of possibilities by cutting its digital twin.
Although the final jewel does not have that many facets, during the training data generation
for the AI-powered cut CAD, several billions of cuts are peformed on the digital twin.
While this could be done in a brute force manner, De Beers Group prefers efficiency,
that is a frugal approach, in order to help saving the blue planet.</p>

<h3>Hope</h3>

<p>The De Beers project "Hope" has its name from the diamond <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Diamond">"Hope"</a>. This diamond was originally
"the French Blue", ownned by Louis XIV, which had been lost during the French Revolution, and later undergone a re-cut,
the largest section having become the "Hope Diamond", still in the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.
While French governments every now and then claim a restitution of this French crown jewel,
an even larger French/US diplomatic crisis lies ahead, with plans of the jewel getting incorported into a crown made by Tiffany and Co.</p>

<h3>Crowns</h3>

<p>As explained in a recent article in a special issue of the <a href="https://boutiquevpc.courrierinternational.com/hors-series/3742-le-nouvel-age-des-empires.html">Courrier International</a>
there is a global tendency for autocrats to make national jewelry manufacturers the official suppliers of crowns and coronets for their governments.</p>

<p>Tiffany plans to integrate the Hope Diamond in a presidential crown
in the style of the Napoleonic Empire. Tiffany further took inspiration from Doge crowns, also called <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corno_ducale">Corno Ducale/a>
and will manufacture them for special government employees. Here again, CGAL came in for the 3D Voronoi structure inside this wonderful crown</p>

<p>Tiffany and Co, Christofle, Pandora and several other jewelry companies are the founding members of the <em>Association of Crown Manufacturers</em>, also known as <em>ACM</em></p>.
