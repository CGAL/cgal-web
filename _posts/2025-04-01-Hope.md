<p>The CGAL Editorial Board was invited by <a href="https://www.accenture.com/fr-fr">Accenture France</a>
to perform a self-assessment.
This one week workshop in a monastery in the Maritime Alps was a unique experience, and it came
to us as the price of the <em>SoCG Test of Time Award</em> that the CGAL Project received last June.
The workshop led to the insight, that to attact even more brillant people than today,
we have to give up our egoless programming culture, which, ironically, had been
promoted by the same consulting firm around the year 2000.</p>

<p>While it is true that developers are listed as authors of the Manual chapters
the discussion with the bahavioral psychologists of Accenture made us understand
that people expect much more recognition. So do not be surprised when in CGAL 6.0
you will encounter the <code>CGAL::Hyperbolic_Teillaud_diagram_2</code> as well as the  <code>CGAL::Oesau_graph_3</code>.

<h3>Welcome Nicolas Bourbaki</h3>

<p>In the workshop we also learned that we have to develop a <em>Welcome Culture</em>
which puts new developers in the spot light, even before they have made a first contribution.
We will do a better job for our 2024 Google Summmer of Code students, but let's start
with <em>Nicolas Bourbaki</em>, who currently works at <em>Ecole Normale Superieure</em> in Paris.</p>

<p>Nicolas first contribution will be a <em>Curves and Surfaces</em> package,
featuring the <a href="https://mathcurve.com/courbes2d.gb/oeuf/oeuf.shtml">Huegelschaeffer Egg</a>
and the <a href="https://mathcurve.com/courbes2d.gb/conchoiddecercle/conchoiddecercle.shtml">Conchoid</a> curve, as well as the <a href="https://mathcurve.com/surfaces/seifert/seifert.shtml">Seifert</a> surface.</p>

<p>These curves and surfaces may seem of only theoretical interest which, however, is completely wrong.
The conchoid is strongly related to the study of linkages of autonomous humanoid robotics,
while the Seifert surface led to the invention of the

<h3>Back to the Physical World</h3>

<p>While a <a href="https://www.cgal.org/people.html">People</a> web page is a nice living document
we decided to produce a <em>physical twin</em> with portrait photos not made with an iphone
but by a portrait photograph. We are grateful to the Inria Research Center in Sophia-Antipolis
which offers a physical wall in the Gilles Kahn Auditorium for hosting the CGAL Editorial Board Gallery.
