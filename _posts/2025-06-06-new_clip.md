<h3>Clipping and Splitting Meshes with Planes</h3>

<p>Several releases ago, CGAL introduced the function <a href="https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Polygon_mesh_processing/group__PMP__corefinement__grp.html#ga88ea5360f9fe65458f9086b453447662">CGAL::Polygon_mesh_processing::clip()</a>,
which enabled users to restrict the volume bounded by a triangle mesh to a halfspace defined
by an oriented plane. Over the releases, this function has been extended to also enable clipping
of surfaces represented by triangle meshes with boundaries, as well as self-intersecting surfaces.
A closely related function, <a href="https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Polygon_mesh_processing/group__PMP__corefinement__grp.html#ga0c49ffd458b13ee9489cad2321656f71">CGAL::Polygon_mesh_processing::split()</a>, can be used
to cut and separate a surface in multiple components.

<h3>10x Runtime Improvements</h3>

<p>
The original implementation of the two functions was a by-product of the Boolean operations
function <a href="https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Polygon_mesh_processing/group__PMP__corefinement__grp.html#ga3ff96d36cad8f37efcdada916c46fbbe">CGAL::Polygon_mesh_processing::corefine_and_compute_intersection()</a>.

With CGAL 6.1, the functions <code>clip()</code> and <code>split()</code> have been reimplemented from scratch, without changing the API.
The new implemention now takes advantage of the fact that the clipper is simply a plane,
for which efficient orientation tests can be performed, which results in a tenfold speed-up,
In addition, the code can now be used over meshes with polygonal faces, which is crucial
to avoid cascading growth of the number of subfaces when a face is clipped several times (see Figure 3).

<h3>Behind the Scenes: a New Function for Mesh Refinement</h3>

<p>The new implementation uses internally a new function introduced in CGAL 6.1 to the Polygon Mesh Processing package:
<a href="https://cgal.geometryfactory.com/CGAL/doc/master/Polygon_mesh_processing/group__PMP__corefinement__grp.html#gacb9d68fa4dea8fd03ec53b56a16d6fc6">CGAL::Polygon_mesh_processing::refine_with_plane()</a>.
This function inserts in an input surface mesh the intersection edges between the surface and a plane,
and provides access to the created intersection edges.

<h4>Status</h4>

<p>All these enhancements are already integrated in CGAL's master branch on the
<a href="https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/">CGAL GitHub repository</a> and
will be officially released in the upcoming version of CGAL, CGAL 6.1, scheduled for mid 2025.</p>
