<p>The CGAL Project began in 1996 as part of the European FP4 Esprit program. Nearly thirty years later,
it continues to be actively developed and widely used, and in 2023 it was recognized with the SoCG
Test of Time Award. At its core, CGAL is a C++ library offering a broad range of geometric algorithms
and data structures.</p>

<p>This talk does not focus on scientific results, technical details, or commercial aspects.
Instead, it will address organizational aspects of the CGAL Open Source Project: the reasoning
behind license choices, the evolution of development infrastructure, the challenges of sustaining
a long-term project, efforts to attract new contributors, and the role of GeometryFactory
as a non-academic partner.</p>
