<h1>A Special Event for a Double Anniversary</h1>

<p>The year 2026 will see two major milestones for CGAL: the 30th anniversary of the project,
and the 50th CGAL developer meeting!</p>

<p>To celebrate this, we will append a special event to the next developer meeting
to get together and meet people who have been involved with CGAL over the years, to share memories,
stories, thoughts, feelings and opinions, both personal and concerning the past, present,
and future of the project that connects us all: CGAL.</p>

<p>The event is intended to be mostly informal and social, with lots of opportunities for individual interaction.
But we also plan to have a short program, with presentations and panel discussions on CGAL, computational geometry,
and open source projects. There are a few items on the program already, and we do not intend
to fully "program" both days of the event. Nevertheless, there is still room for contributions.
So please do not hesitate to contact the organizers at
<a href="mailto:anniversary@cgal.org">anniversary@cgal.org</a>
if you would like to contribute.</p>
