<h2>With a Package Manager</h2>

<p><em>Note that the package managers are not maintained by the CGAL project. Consequently,
the latest stable release of CGAL might not be immediately available and you should check the version
offered by your package manager.</em></p>

<p>We recommend using a package manager as this will ensure that all essential third party dependencies
are present, and with the correct versions.</p>

<pre>
# Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, ...
sudo apt-get install libcgal-dev
</pre>

<p>For other distributions or package manager, please consult your respective documentation.</p>

<p>A step-by-step guide showing how to install and use CGAL with a package manager is available in the
<a href="https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/windows.html#title0">CGAL Documentation</a>.</p>

<br>
<h2>With a Source Archive</h2>

<p>You can also obtain the CGAL library sources directly from from the
<a href="https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/releases">Releases</a> page of the CGAL project.</p>

<p>A step-by-step guide showing how to install and use CGAL with sources is available in the
<a href="https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/windows.html#title0">CGAL Documentation</a>.</p>

<br>
<h2>Through Github</h2>

<p>Advanced users can clone the current development version of CGAL from
<a href="https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/">GitHub</a> to enjoy early access to new features.</p>

<p>Please note that the directory layout and build process of the development version on GitHub
