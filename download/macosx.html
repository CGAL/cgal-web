<h2>With a Package Manager</h2>

<p><em>Note that the package managers are not maintained by the CGAL project. Consequently,
the latest stable release of CGAL might not be immediately available. On Brew, you can check
the version of CGAL currently offered on the <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/cgal">CGAL formulae page</a>.</em></p>

<p>We recommand to use <a href="https://brew.sh/">Brew</a> to get CGAL on macOS (CGAL is also available on
<a href="https://www.macports.org/" target="_blank">MacPorts</a>).</p>

<pre>
# using homebrew
brew install cgal
</pre>

<p>A step-by-step guide showing how to install and use CGAL with a package manager is available in the
<a href="https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/usage.html">CGAL Documentation</a>.</p>

<br>
<h2>With a Source Archive</h2>

<p>You can also obtain the CGAL library sources directly from from the
<a href="https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/releases">Releases</a> page of the CGAL project.</p>

<p>A step-by-step guide showing how to install and use CGAL with sources is available in the
<a href="https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/usage.html">CGAL Documentation</a>.</p>

<br>
<h2>Through Github</h2>

<p>Advanced users can clone the current development version of CGAL from
<a href="https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/">GitHub</a> to enjoy early access to new features.</p>

<p>Please note that the directory layout and build process of the development version on GitHub
are different from the release version. A basic usage guide is available
on the CGAL project's <a href="https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/blob/main/INSTALL.md">Install.md</a>.</p>
