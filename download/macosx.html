<h2>Build from Source on UNIX-Like Systems</h2>
<p>
To build CGAL from source on Mac OS X you have to <a href="/download/last" target="_blank">download a release as a tarball</a> or you can clone the current development version of CGAL from <a href="https://github.com/CGAL/cgal" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. The build process is documented in the <a href="http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/installation.html" target="_blank">Installation Manual</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that the directory layout and build process of the development version on GitHub are different from the release version.</p>
