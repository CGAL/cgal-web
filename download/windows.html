<h2>With a Package Manager</h2>

<p><em>Note that vcpkg is not maintained by the CGAL project. Consequently, the latest stable release
of CGAL might not be immediately available. You can check the version of CGAL currently available
through vcpkg on the <code>version</code> line on the dedicated CGAL <code>.json</code> file on
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/ports/cgal/vcpkg.json">github.com/microsoft/vcpkg</a>.</em></p>

<p>We recommand to use <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg" target="_blank">vcpkg</a>:</p>

<pre>
vcpkg install cgal
</pre>

<p>A step-by-step guide showing how to install and use CGAL with vcpkg is available in the
<a href="https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/windows.html#title0">CGAL Documentation</a>.</p>

<br>
<h2>With a Source Archive</h2>

<p>You can download a release source archive from the <a href="https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/releases">Releases</a>
page of the CGAL project.

<p>A step-by-step guide showing how to install and use CGAL from source is available in the
<a href="https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/windows.html#title8">CGAL Documentation</a>.</p>

<br>
<h2>Through Github</h2>

<p>Advanced users can clone the current development version of CGAL from
<a href="https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/">GitHub</a> to enjoy early access to new features.</p>

<p>Please note that the directory layout and build process of the development version on GitHub
are different from the release version. A basic usage guide is available
on the CGAL project's <a href="https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/blob/main/INSTALL.md">Install.md</a>.</p>
