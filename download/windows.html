<h2>With a Package Manager</h2>

<p><em>Note that vcpkg is not maintained by the CGAL project. Consequently, the latest stable release
of CGAL might not be immediately available. You can check the version of CGAL currently available
through vcpkg on the <code>VERSION</code> line on the dedicated CGAL control file on
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/ports/cgal/CONTROL">github.com/microsoft/vcpkg</a>.</em></p>

<p>We recommand to use <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg" target="_blank">vcpkg</a>:</p>

<pre>
vcpkg install cgal
</pre>

<p>A step-by-step guide showing how to install and use CGAL with vcpkg is available in the
<a href="https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/windows.html#title0">CGAL Documentation</a>.</p>

<br>
<h2>With the CGAL Installer</h2>

<p>You can download and run <code>CGAL-[Version]-Setup.exe</code> from the
<a href="https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/releases">Releases</a> page of the CGAL project.
It is a self-extracting executable that downloads the CGAL header files,
and optionally the source code of the examples and demos.
Additionally, it can also download precompiled versions of GMP and MPFR, two mandatory dependencies of CGAL.</p>

<p>A step-by-step guide showing how to install and use CGAL with the CGAL installer is available in the
<a href="https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/windows.html#title8">CGAL Documentation</a>.</p>

<br>
<h2>With a Source Archive</h2>

<p>Instead of using the CGAL installer, you can also download release tarballs from the
<a href="https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/releases">Releases</a> page of the CGAL project.
The sole difference is that the installer can also download precompiled GMP and MPFR libraries.</p>

<br>
<h2>Through Github</h2>

<p>Advanced users can clone the current development version of CGAL from
<a href="https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/">GitHub</a> to enjoy early access to new features.</p>

<p>Please note that the directory layout and build process of the development version on GitHub
are different from the release version. A basic usage guide is available
on the CGAL project's <a href="https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/blob/master/INSTALL.md">Install.md</a>.</p>
