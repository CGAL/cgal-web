<P>
For the impatient reader, let us get to the bottom line right away:
<P>

CGAL produces correct results, in spite of intermediate roundoff
errors. If three lines meet in one point, they will do so in CGAL as
well, and if a fourth line misses this point by 1.0e-380, then it also
misses it in CGAL. Situations that are sometimes tagged as
"degenerate" (like a 3-D point set actually living in a 2-D plane) are
properly handled by CGAL. In fancy terms, this is called the <EM>exact
computation paradigm</EM>, and it ultimately relies on computing with
numbers of arbitrary precision. The exact computation paradigm is not
an invention of CGAL, but CGAL is probably <EM>the</EM> place that
implements it at a large scale.<P>

Such guaranteed correctness requires that CGAL is properly used (see
the <A HREF="FAQ.html#inexact_NT">FAQ section on using inexact number
types</A>), and it comes at a price: compared to algorithms that use
fixed-precision numbers only, the performance is lower. In the best
case (as in computing Delaunay triangulations in 3-space), the
overhead is around 25%. This is possible because CGAL tracks <EM>error
bounds</EM> and resorts to extended precision only when this is really
needed.<P>

Computing arrangements of segments is an application that is more
demanding with respect to extended precision, and the overhead may
increase to 80%. In other applications, the price of exact computation
can grow well beyond that. But whatever the price: if you decide to
pay it, you will not have to worry about robustness issues.<P>

It may well be that you don't worry about robustness issues anyway,
maybe because your favorite geometric software has never let you down
in this respect. You may just have been lucky in this case: robustness
in geometric computing is a delicate issue that is not amenable to the
usual numerical methods that are successful in other fields. If you
want to understand why even your favorite geometric software may fail,
and how CGAL solves the robustness problem, you are now welcome among
the more patient readers.<P>

<H3>Robustness: The Simple Approach</H3>
<P>
In working with real numbers on real computers, there is one basic
rule: never compare two floating-point numbers for true equality. In
theory, you might be able to deduce that they are the same, but due to
roundoff, they always turn out slightly different.<P>

You certainly know this, and you also know a simple approach for
solving the problem in practice:Â if the two numbers differ by less
than some small tolerance, treat them as equal. This often works, but
you can never be sure about it. <P>

<H3>The Numerical Approach</H3>

<P>
If roundoff may accumulate, the simple approach definitely fails, but
you know that there are well-established and reliable techniques from
numerical analysis to control roundoff and get robust code. So you
assume that the makers of high-quality geometric software have made
their homework and get this right.<P>

But in spite of all efforts, they sometimes don't. There are two
problems here: first of all, most of the above-mentioned techniques to
fight roundoff apply to <EM>numerical</EM> computing (things like
solving systems of linear equations), where answers that are slightly
off are acceptable. Such numerical computations are frequent in many
fields, among them computer graphics and image processing. The field
of <EM>geometric</EM> computing is different and comparatively new; a
full arsenal of numerical weapons simply does not exist.<P>

The second and deeper problem is that numerical weapons are <EM>per
se</EM> less effective in geometric computing than they are in other
fields. In geometry, we don't compute numbers but structures: convex
hulls, triangulations, etc. In building these structures, the
underlying algorithms ask questions like "is a point to the left, to
the right, or on the line through two other points?" Such questions
have no answers that are "slightly off". Either you get it right, or
you don't. And if you don't, the algorithm might go completely astray.
Even the most fancy roundoff control techniques don't help here: it's
primarily a <EM>combinatorial</EM> problem, not a numerical one. <P>

<P>Makers of geometric software know the issue, of course, and they take
precautions. But in the best case, these only work most of the time,
in the situations encountered by the "typical" user of the software.
But your application is special, and it may just happen that the code
goes astray on your data. This will result in considerably wrong
output, or even crashes of the code. The problem is amplified by the
fact that geometric software is in many cases just a by-product of
computer graphics software, and as such, it does not specifically
target at geometric computing.<P>

<H3>The CGAL Approach</H3>
<P>
Here is where CGAL is different. We concentrate on the geometry (after
all, that's what we do best), and the CGAL algorithms themselves don't
contain any numerical security measures to keep them from going
astray. At first sight, this may look like being different in the
wrong direction; indeed, naive use of CGAL may result in all the
robustness problems indicated above, including crashes at runtime. <P>

But if CGAL is properly used, the issues of roundoff and its
combinatorial consequences completely disappear. Here is how it works:
In CGAL, we write the high-level algorithms in terms of a well-chosen
set of basic questions (where is a point with respect to a line?) and
basic objects (like a circle through three points). Doing this in the
right way is not always easy, but once it is done, we have outsourced
all the numerical issues, and we only have to make sure that the part
of CGAL concerned with the basics returns correct results. Given this,
the algorithms on top of it just work. Not in most cases, but always!<P>

Getting the underlying basics always right must obviously involve
something beyond naive floating-point computations, and it indeed
does. The details are pretty complex, but what essentially happens is
that we increase the numerical precision of the computations, if
necessary, by using numbers that in principle allow arbitrary
precision. These techniques are constantly being refined, with the
goal of increasing the overall performance of the high-level
algorithms under the exact computation paradigm.<P>

<H3>What Does It Mean For You?</H3>
<P>
The important thing for you to know is that you don't have to know
about it. It all works automatically and behind the scenes.<P>

Well, almost. If you look at an example program in CGAL, it typically
starts with a long sequence of typedef declarations, and even not
taking this into account, the program may look somewhat more
complicated than what you expect from its functionality. This is to
some extent a consequence of CGAL's exact computation paradigm.<P>

The chain of typedefs is necessary in order to choose the appropriate
parameters for the algorithm. The numerical robustness handling does
not happen in the algorithm itself, but in its basic questions and
objects. CGAL offers many different ways of getting these basics
right, and which one is the best depends on the concrete
application. That's why you have to choose. But in most cases, you can
simply work with the settings that you find in the example program
closest to your intended application, and you will be fine.<P>


Once you get to the actual code, it's also some functionality that
looks unnecessarily complicated. For example, distance computations in
CGAL return the squared distance instead of what you really want to
know, namely the plain distance. Couldn't CGAL take care of the final
square root computation itself? If you have followed the previous
discussion, you will be with us when we say "no". The result of
applying a square root is usually an irrational number with infinite
precision, so all that CGAL could do is give you an approximation. (We
<EM>can</EM> actually give you the exact square root as an algebraic
number, but it would be somewhat frivolous to impose such magic on you
by default.) For you, an approximation might be sufficient, but the
computed distance can also be used as a "basic object" in some
other CGAL algorithms. For that, it must be exact in order not to
compromise the overall design.<P>

Admittedly, reading and writing CGAL code takes some getting used to, 
but now that you have an idea what's behind it, you may find it less
obscure. <P>
