 <li id="raytracing"><h3>Quality Rendering through Ray Tracing</h3>


		<div style="float:left"><img src="https://cgal.github.io/cgal-web/images/gsoc/liver.png" alt=""></div>
    <b>Contact:</b> <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Pierre.Alliez/">Pierre Alliez</a> and Stephane Tayeb from INRIA
    <br><b>Description:</b><br>
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhotoRealistic_RenderMan">PhotoRealistic RenderMan (PRMan for short)</a>
    and <a href="http://www.mentalimages.com/index.php">Mental Ray</a>
    are de facto standards for generating high quality images by ray tracing, and very good
    open source RenderMan implementations such as <a href="http://aqsis.sf.net">Aqsis</a> or
    <a href="http://www.renderpixie.com/">Pixie</a> exist.
    The goal is to elaborate upon a CGAL C++ rendering component devoted to the generation of
    RenderMan files from 3D scenes composed of 3D CGAL objects. The motivation is
    to enable the user of CGAL 3D demos to generate for a given camera viewpoint
    high definition images with complex transparency and lighting effects. One example motivation
    is the rendering of tetrahedron meshes with glass material for the facets and silver
    cylinders for the edges to reveal the internal structure of the mesh. Another motivation
    is the rendering of 3D point sets with normal attributes.
    <br>
    One part of the component will handle the camera and world placement from the QGLViewer arcball chosen
    for the 3D demos of CGAL so that the viewpoint and frustum of the ray-traced images match
    the ones of the demos (the idea is to make a ray-traced snapshot of the current scene).
    <br>
    Another part will generate 3D scenes from all 3D finite objects
    of CGAL such as triangles, segments, tetrahedra, points, iso cuboids and spheres. As the
    point, resp. line primitives are rendered by spheres, resp. cylinders, some options must
    be provided to tune the radii. Finally, the component will contain a few functions to facilitate
    the selection of materials, transparency and lights for collections of primitives.
    <br><b>Required skills:</b> Templated C++, hands on experience with ray tracing,
    knowledge in graphical projection and camera models and taste for computer graphics.

  <li id="oracless"><h3>Oracles for Subdivision Surfaces</h3>

		<div style="float:left;margin-right:1em;"><img src="https://cgal.github.io/cgal-web/images/gsoc/torus.png" alt=""></div>
    <b>Contact:</b> <a href="http://www.inria.fr/sophia/members/Pierre.Alliez/">Pierre Alliez</a> from INRIA
    <br><b>Description:</b><br> If you type "Ray Tracing Subdivision Surfaces" or " Packet-based Ray
    Tracing of Catmull-Clark Subdivision Surfaces" in Google scholar you will find a series of papers
    which propose solutions to the problem of ray tracing the limit surface of a subdivision algorithm
    applied onto coarse control meshes. For surface or volume mesh generation CGAL uses a generic
    interface where the input domain boundary is only known through simple intersection tests with
    3D segments, lines or rays. The goal of this project is to implement intersection oracles for
    the Loop and Catmull-Clark subdivision schemes for which closed form formulas exist
    for evaluating their limit surfaces (see article: Charles Loop and Scott Schaefer.
    "Approximating Catmull-Clark Subdivision Surfaces with Bicubic Patches".
    ACM Transactions on Graphics, Vol. 27 No. 1 Article 8. March 2008).
    The goal is to mesh the limit surface of a subdivision
    surface applied to very coarse control meshes without having to perform the
    subdivision itself.
    <br><b>Required skills:</b> Templated C++, subdivision surfaces and taste for reliable
                                geometric computing.

  <li id="convexhull3d"><h3>Improved 3D convex hull</h3>
    <b>Contact:</b> <a href="http://www.inria.fr/sophia/members/Olivier.Devillers/">Olivier Devillers</a> from INRIA
    <br><b>Description:</b><br>The current implementation of 3D convex hull is a bit slower
    than 3D Delaunay triangulation and 10 times slower than 2D Delaunay triangulation.
    The aim of this work is to improve the current performances of the current 3D convex hull.<br>
    This can be achieved through the use of 3D triangulation for dynamic
3D convex hull (and not Delaunay triangulation as suggested in the current manual),
and the use of 2D Triangulation (non Delaunay) for the maintenance of upper and lower hull for incremental 3D convex hull.
    <br><b>Required skills:</b> Templated C++ and taste for computational geometry!
    <br><br>

<li id="modulargcd"><h3>Modular GCD for multivariate polynomials</h3>
    <b>Contact:</b> <a href="http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~hemmer/">Michael Hemmer</a>
    <br><b>Description:</b><br> Based on the package <a href="http://www.cgal.org/Manual/3.4/doc_html/cgal_manual/Modular_arithmetic/Chapter_main.html">Modular Arithmetic</a> the current implementation of the gcd in the <a href="http://www.cgal.org/Manual/3.4/doc_html/cgal_manual/Polynomial/Chapter_main.html">Polynomials</a> package already provides a modular gcd for univariate polynomials. However, the implementation for multivariate polynomials only profits from this in the sense that the modular arithmetic is applied in the last step of the recursion, that is, within the computations for univariate polynomials. This was caused by the fact that the current implementation was more focused on the support of polynomials over certain algebraic extensions.<br>

The fundamental structure of the algorithm is as follows. The algorithm proceeds in rounds. In each round it selects a prime and maps the coefficients of the input polynomials in the corresponding prime field. Over this field the gcd is computed using the Euclidean Algorithm. This is repeated until the actual gcd can be recovered using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. This method is more efficient than a naive application of the Euclidean Algorithm since it avoids the exponential coefficient growth in intermediate expressions. <br>

The first <b>milestone</b> of this project is to provide a modular gcd for multivariate polynomials over the integers. This implementation should be compared with existing implementations. We consider this implementation as the default implementation for CGAL. In case CGAL is configured with other libraries that provide a better gcd the code should automatically switch to a better implementation.
A second possible <b>milestone</b>  is the support of polynomials over algebraic extensions fields. A fundamental difference to polynomials over integers is that the gcd is not performed over a Field since the extensions may induce zero divisors. This requires special handling within the code and may even effect the current design of the current <a href="http://www.cgal.org/Manual/3.4/doc_html/cgal_manual/NumberTypeSupport/Chapter_main.html"> Number Type Support</a>  and <a href="http://www.cgal.org/Manual/3.4/doc_html/cgal_manual/Algebraic_foundations/Chapter_main.html">Algebraic Foundations</a> of CGAL.
    <br><b>Required skills:</b> Templated C++ and a little bit of algebra.
    <br><br>


<li id="random"><h3>Allowing different random number generators to be used in CGAL</h3>
  <b>Contact:</b> <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/fcacciola">Fernando Cacciola</a>
  <br><b>Description:</b><br> CGAL provides the class
<a href="http://www.cgal.org/Manual/3.4/doc_html/cgal_manual/Generator_ref/Class_Random.html#Cross_link_anchor_1766"><tt>CGAL::Random</tt></a>
for generating seeded random values via the <tt>srand</tt> function of the <tt>C</tt> standard library. This class is
used as the random number generator in some algorithms like the
<a href="http://www.cgal.org/Manual/3.4/doc_html/cgal_manual/Generator/Chapter_main.html">random geometric object generators</a>.<br>
Since all those random generator functions take an instance of class <tt>CGAL::Random</tt> it is not possible to choose different distributions (the class doesn't allow that).<br>
The goal of this project is to extend the API of the random geometric object generators to accept other underlying random number generators, such as those from
the <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_38_0/libs/random/index.html">Boost.Random</a> library or the upcoming <tt>std::random</tt> in the next C++ standard, C++0x.<br>
The tasks involve: (1) identify all places within CGAL that use CGAL::Random, study their requirement and elaborate the necessary new concepts,
(2) compare the required concepts with those in <tt>Boost.Random</tt> and <tt>std::random</tt> to design interoperability strategies, (3) modify the functions
to accept a parameterized (template) random number generator (of the appropriate concept), instead of an instance of <tt>CGAL::Random</tt>.<br>
   <br><b>Required skills:</b> Templated C++ and knowledge of concept based design.
    <br><br>


<li id="boostification"><h3>Replacing some basic non-geometric tools in CGAL by Boost/TR1/C++0x functionality</h3>
    <b>Contact:</b> <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Sylvain.Pion/">Sylvain Pion</a> from INRIA
    <br><b>Description:</b><br> The CGAL project started in 1996, before the
    first C++ standard was released, and before the <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</a>
    project was launched.  CGAL has accumulated a number of geometry-independent tools
    which these days offer duplicate functionality with what is (a) in TR1, (b) planned for
    the next C++ standard C++0x, and/or (c) are in Boost.  Doing the replacement would help
    in the long-term by easing maintenance : (a) less code to maintain, and (b)
    new people are more likely to know about a standard tool, and it will be
    more useful to them to learn about them, rather than something
    which is only in CGAL and with no geometric or scientific flavor.
    <br>
    The goal of this project would be to "cleanup" CGAL by replacing as many of these as possible.
    Of course, depending on the case, there can be constraints in terms of efficiency,
    API compatibility, deprecation paths, etc.  So, the task is non trivial,
    but there are pieces easier than others.  It should be a nice way to learn about various
    standard tools in CGAL, Boost and C++0x.
    <br>Some examples of things to be considered :
    <pre>
    Filter_iterator        -&gt;  boost::filter_iterator
    Object                 -&gt;  boost::any/variant
    Triple/Quadruple       -&gt;  TR1::tuple/array
    Unique_hash_map        -&gt;  TR1::unordered_map/set
    copy_n                 -&gt;  C++0x::copy_n
    iterator ranges        -&gt;  Boost.Range
    Timers                 -&gt;  Boost.Timers
    Integer8/16/32         -&gt;  int32_t...
    min_max_element        -&gt;  C++0x (or TR1 ?)
    predecessor/successor  -&gt;  prev/next (C++0x/TR1)
    </pre>
    Note that there is a separate project idea for Random Numbers generators.

    <br>
    <br><b>Required skills:</b> C++, templates.
    <br><br>


<li id="fileformats"><h3>Standard File Format readers/writers</h3>
    <b>Contact:</b> <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Pierre.Alliez/">Pierre Alliez from INRIA</a>
    <br><b>Description:</b><br> CGAL interacts with other systems dealing with geometric data sets.
    These can be simple point sets ("xyz"), surface meshes (OFF, OBJ, PLY), volume meshes (ABAQUS, etc)
    or more involved CAD/CAM file formats (DXF, STL).  There are already a few file
    format readers and writers in CGAL.
    <br>
    The goal of this project is to obtain a nice collection of high-quality readers/writers for
    standard file format.  They would be usable independently of CGAL data structures and algorithms,
    but with a C++ interface which will make them easy and natural to use with CGAL algorithms.
    <br>
    The first task will consist in precisely identifying the standard file formats which exist
    for dealing with geometry, then see which are already used in CGAL, or potentially useful
    for CGAL to support.
    <br>
    Then, the work will consist in designing the interface of the parsers, based on the needs
    of current use in CGAL, and then implementing them, together with their documentation.
    To start with priority will be given to surface and volume meshes.
    Finally, as time permits, updating the CGAL code to use these might be nice!
    <br>
    <br><b>Required skills:</b> C++, templates, parser tools (Boost.Spirit
    maybe ?), some ideas of what geometric data is about, but no a priori
    knowledge of geometric algorithms is needed.
    <br><br>

<li id="vtk"><h3>A VTK Interface for CGAL components</h3>
 <b>Contact:</b> <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/andreasfabri">Andreas Fabri</a> from Geometry Factory
    <br><b>Description:</b><br>
    <p>VTK is an object-oriented software system for computer graphics, visualization, and image processing. VTK has the
      notion of a graphics pipeline. There are two basic types of objects involved: data objects and process objects,
      and compatible objects can be assembled in a pipeline with setInput and getInput methods.</p>

    <p>The goal of this project is to wrap the CGAL algorithms, starting with the CGAL surface and volume mesh generators for 3D images, so that they
      become VTK process objects which fit in the VTK graphics pipeline, without that VTK users have to learn CGAL.</p>

    <br><b>Required skills:</b> C++, VTK.<br>


<li id="webservice"><h3>A web service that solves geometric problems.</h3>
    <b>Contact:</b> <a href="http://acg.cs.tau.ac.il">Efi Fogel</a> from Tel Aviv University
    <br><b>Description:</b><br>
    <p>Create a web service open to the public that offers solutions to the geometric problem described below. The service should be integrated into <a href="http://acg.cs.tau.ac.il/">this</a> website, which runs Plone (an open source content management system). The service should be designed in such a way that it can easily extend to other geometric problems.</p>

     <p>Given a polygonal robot <em>Q</em>, which can translate (but not necessarily rotate) in a room cluttered with polygonal obstacles, maintain a data structure that can efficiently answer queries of the following form: Given a start position <em>s</em> of some reference point in <em>Q</em> and a goal position <em>g</em>, plan a collision-free motion of the robot from <em>s</em> to <em>g</em>.</p>

     <p>The feed is done in two steps. First, the user uploads the geometric data that describes the work space. Then, the user uploads the queries in forms of pairs of start and goal positions - a pair at a time. For each pair the geometric description of the collision-free path is computed and offered to the user. The web page can illustrate the workspace, the queries, and the obtained solutions.</p>

     <p>The user can choose values for several parameters, such as the quality of the path (e.g., short, high-clearance, shortest subject to prescribed clearance) and whether the robot can touch the obstacles.</p>

    <br><b>Required skills:</b> C++, Plone, and PHP.<br>
    The core of the solution should be an application written in C++ based on CGAL arrangements and other CGAL components implementing some motion planning algorithms. The mentor will provide description of the algorithms and code components. An application that solves the most simple variant already exists.

The interface should be through a web page integrated into an existing Plone based website. Basic skill in managing Plone websites is required. We assume that for some desired features some extra skills in Plone and PHP are required as well, although they may be acquired as the project advances.

    <br><b>Description:</b><br>
    <p>This idea is more a collaboration with another software project, also GSOC mentoring organization : the <a href="http://www.scilab.org/">Scilab</a> project.  The idea is to revisit the draft <a href="http://cglab.gforge.inria.fr/">interface between those two software</a>, done years ago, but this time using <a href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a>.  Main mentoring would be done within the Scilab project, co-mentored on the CGAL side as well.  See <a href="http://wiki.scilab.org/Contributor_-_CGAL">here</a> for details.

    <br><b>Description:</b><br>
    <p>Algorithms in CGAL are currently essentially sequential.  Some work has begun on parallelizing the computation of Delaunay triangulations, but a lot remains to be done, in various areas.  Students can propose important areas that they think they could parallelize.

    package using Qt and the QGLViewer. The
    Triangulation_3 package contains algorithms for computation of
    Delaunay triangulations and weighted Delaunay triangulations for a
    given point set. We aim for an interactive demo that illustrates
    the package functionality and the used algorithm. So far the 3D
    demos in CGAL allow for very little interaction. We expect the
    participant to come up with a nice and easy-to-use mode of
    interaction that can possibly be reused by other demos in the
    future.<br>
    A first milestone could be a non-interactive demo that contains all
    the functionality. A second milestone would be to add the
    interactivity.

  <li id="python"><h3>A Python binding for CGAL</h3>
    <b>Contact:</b> <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/andreasfabri">Andreas Fabri</a>

    <br><b>Description:</b><br>
         CGAL algorithms and data structures are written in C++ based on the generic programming paradigm, that is in the spirit of
         the STL and Boost libraries.  In order to offer a <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> API for the rich functionality of CGAL, wrapper generation
         and code inspection tools like <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_37_0/libs/python/doc/index.html">Boost.Python</a>
         and <a href="http://www.language-binding.net/pyplusplus/pyplusplus.html">Py++</a>  are useful. However, straightforward usage of these tools does not
         necessarily map good C++ code design on good Python code design, that is the generated code is not automatically 'pythonic'.
         This project aims for the latter, and we take a two step approach to get there.
<BR><BR>

<EM>1. Automatic Language Binding Generation</EM>
<BR>
The first step is to use Boost.Python and Py++ with the goal to obtain a Python language binding for large parts of CGAL.
This part of the  project can profit from the experiences made in the <a href="http://cgal-python.gforge.inria.fr/">CGAL-Python</a> project,
which, back in 2006, only used Boost.Python. Although the usage of only this tool lead to a "C++-in-Python-syntax"-version,
this first version shows how to make the C++ code tool-friendlier. Adding Py++ makes the wrapping easier,
as it uses code inspection and API pattern matching, but more importantly, it allows to do adaptations on the Python side
of the wrapper code.
<BR>

<EM>2. Pythonic CGAL</EM>
<BR>
For two strongly demanded CGAL packages (<a href="http://www.cgal.org/Pkg/Triangulation3">3D Triangulations<a> and
<a href="http://www.cgal.org/Pkg/Polyhedron">Polyhedral Surfaces</a>), design a pythonic API
based on feedback from current cgal-python users. This second step will consist of iterations of Step 1, and
it will again involve C++ development, tool usage, and Python programming.<BR>

<br>
The outcome of the project will be two pythonic CGAL packages that are ready to use, the recipe for obtaining
further pythonic CGAL packages, and experience which allows to estimate the effort necessary to make entire CGAL pythonic.
In case we underestimate the effort, Step 1 alone will be a valuable deliverable, and every iteration of Step 2
makes the CGAL packages more pythonic.<BR>

<BR>


The project will be mentored by people knowing CGAL, Python, and the tools to bridge the gap:
<UL>
<LI> Andreas Fabri, CGAL developer, member of the CGAL Editorial Board, and chief officer of GeometryFactory,
<LI> Sylvain Pion, INRIA, chair of the CGAL Editorial Board, and co-author of CGAL-PYTHON,
<LI> Matthias Baas, author of the <a href="http://cgkit.sourceforge.net">Python Computer Graphics Kit</a>
<LI> Jelle Ferringa, EZCT Architecture & Design Research, contributor to <a href="http://www.pythonocc.org">pythonOCC</a>,
  the Python binding for OpenCascade, and Julie Bernauer, INRIA, who are both CGAL-PYTHON power users.
</UL>

<BR>

<b>Useful skills for this project are:</b><br>

<UL>
<LI> Python language skills & some experience in writing extension modules for Python,
<LI> Good C++ language skills & experience compiling tools and libraries,
<LI> Knowledge about how CGAL works (on an API level),
<LI> Experience with Boost.Python (it's a bonus having wrapped a few non-trivial classes manually),
<LI> Experience using Py++ & dependencies (gccxml, pygccxml) to generate the wrapper code.
</UL>

  <li id="docbook"><h3>Switching the manual to DocBook</h3>
    <b>Contact:</b> <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Sylvain.Pion/">Sylvain Pion</a>
                and/or ???
    <br><b>Description:</b><br>
    The CGAL manual is written in LaTeX, using a custom LaTeX style to describe C++ parts.
    <br>
    It provides PDF and HTML output.  Both are of good quality, but switching to a more modern
    and standard system would ease writing of the manual, and would make future evolution simpler.
    <br>
    We propose to investigate the use of the <a href="http://www.docbook.org/">DocBook</a> standard.
    <br>
    In order to connect it with C++ and CGAL, it might be a good idea to use
    <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_37_0/doc/html/boostbook.html">Boost.Book</a>.
    <br>
    The challenge here is to plan and perform an automatic conversion from the LaTeX style, to Doxygen
    comments (see other project), and then, from Doxygen to DocBook via Boost.Book.
    <br>
    In order to ease the transition, a tool converting Doxygen comments to the current LaTeX manual format
    has already been written.
    <br><b>Required skills:</b> XML, LaTeX, maybe Perl or other text processing tools.

  <li id="doxygen"><h3>Transforming the LaTeX reference manual to Doxygen comments</h3>
    <b>Contact:</b> <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Sylvain.Pion/">Sylvain Pion</a>
    <br><b>Other CGAL developers interested:</b> Andreas Meyer and Laurent Saboret
    <br><b>Description:</b><br>
    The CGAL manual is written in LaTeX, using a custom LaTeX style and a custom LaTeX processor to describe a C++ API.
    It provides PDF and HTML output. Both are of good quality, but switching to a more modern and standard system would ease writing of the manual, and would make future evolution simpler.
    <br>
    <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/">Doxygen</a> is the de facto standard for including
    documentation inside C++ source code.
    <br>
    Besides easing the maintenance of the code and the documentation, this format also helps
    automatic tools to extract documentation.  For example, such as those producing
    <a href="#python">automatically documented Python wrappers</a>.
    It can also be a step towards switching the documentation system to something like DocBook
    in the longer term.
    <br>
    Some work has already begun (by Andreas Meyer) to semi-automatically
    retrofit the current documentation written in LaTeX, inside the source
    code, but it needs to be continued and completed.
    <br>
    In order to allow for a progressive transition, Laurent Saboret has also
    started to write (and use) a tool that converts back the doxygen comments
    into our current LaTeX style.  This tool is meant to be used in the mean
    time, while the transition is not yet complete.
    <br>
    The challenge here is the sheer size of documentation, the heavy use of C++
    templates and finding a reliable and mostly automatic way to relate
    documentation from the existing manual to the corresponding place inside
    the source code. This also involves analyzing and transforming C++ code
    fragments such as method signatures and hierarchies of specialized
    templates. We re-use our existing LaTeX processor to output an intermediate
    format, for further analysis.
    <br><b>Required skills:</b> Doxygen, LaTeX, and Perl or other text processing and scripting tools.
