  \textbf{\large The Computational Geometry Algorithm Library (\cgal{})
    open-source project, has been accepted to participate in the 2015 Google
    Summer of Code (GSoC) program; see \url{http://www.google-melange.com/}.
    This means that Google is supporting \cgal{} by funding ((5000 USD)
    some internships potentially from all over the world, for writing code
    under the guidance of experienced developers, so called mentors.}

  \textbf{{\large If you are a smart developer, have the time, and
    would like to contribute and to get paid for that, you should
    apply! If you have some master or PhD students who can spend their
    summer (full time) on a nice \cgal{} project, please advise them
    to apply.} Applications are accepted till May~3rd.}

  \textbf{\large We have already listed several ideas for projects and
    instructions to applicants at
    \url{http://www.cgal.org/project_ideas.html}. If you find a project
    that suits your expertise and interest, contact the mentor of the
    project to get acquainted with her or him and to obtain more details.}
