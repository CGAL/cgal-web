  \textbf{\large The Computational Geometry Algorithm Library
    (\cgal{}) open-source project, has been accepted to participate in
    the 2024 Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program; see
    \url{https://g.co/gsoc}.  This means that
    Google is supporting \cgal{} by funding several internships
    potentially from all over the world, for writing code under the
    guidance of experienced developers, so called mentors.}

  \textbf{{\large If you are a smart developer, have the time, and
    would like to contribute and to get paid for that, you should
    apply! If you have some master or PhD students who can spend their
    summer (full time) on a nice \cgal{} project, please advise them
    to apply.} Applications are accepted till April~2\textsuperscript{nd}.}

  \textbf{\large We have already listed several ideas for projects and
    instructions to applicants at
    \url{https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/wiki/Project-Ideas}. If you
    find a project that suits your expertise and interest, contact the
    mentor of the project to get acquainted with her or him and to
    obtain more details.}

  \textbf{Programming online from their home, GSoC contributors spend
    12+ weeks on their projects earning stipends upon completion of
    their milestones.  Volunteer mentors help GSoC contributors plan
    their time, answer questions and provide guidance on best
    practices, project-speciÔ¨Åc tools, and community norms while
    helping integrate GSoC contributors into their communities.}

  \textbf{GSoC contributors receive an invaluable learning experience,
    an introduction to the global FOSS community and something that
    potential employers love to see on resumes!}
