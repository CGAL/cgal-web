The letters of the original CGAL logo were made following:
<A HREF="http://www.goines.net">David Lance Goines</A>, 
<I>A Constructed Roman Alphabet: a Geometric Analysis
of the Greek and Roman Capitals and of the Arabic Numerals.</I> 
David R. Gordine, Boston, 1982.<BR>

Here are, for example, the precise instructions to construct the letter 'C':

<ul>
  <li>Construct first a square ABCD, and bisect AC at E, BD at F, AB at G, and CD at H.</li>
  <li>Draw the straight lines EF and GH, thereby establishing a point I at their intersection.</li>
  <li>From the center I, describe a circle JIK on EF, the diameter of which is one-ninth the distance AB.</li>
  <li>Using that same radius, describe a circle LJI, thereby establishing a point N on the perimeter of the circle I.</li>
  <li>Using that same radius, describe a circle IKM, thereby establishing a point O on the perimeter of the circle I.</li>
  <li>Draw the straight line NO, and produce it to intersect AG at P and HD at Q.</li>
  <li>From the point I, construct a line at right angles to PQ, thereby establishing on the perimeter of the circle I the points T and S.</li>
  <li>Produce IT to intersect EC at Y.</li>
  <li>From the center I, describe a circle Z tangential to AB, thereby establishing on PN a point R.</li>
  <li>Using the radius IK, describe from the center R a circle VRU.</li>
  <li>Using that same radius, decribe circles from the centers V and U.</li>
  <li>Bisect the intersections of the circles V and R, thereby establishing a point W on VR.</li>
  <li>Bisect the intersections of the circles R and U, thereby establishing a point X on RU.</li>
  <li>From the center I, describe a circle e intersecting the point W.</li>
  <li>From the center I, describe a circle f intersecting the point X.</li>
  <li>From the center S, describe a circle g intersecting the point R.</li>
  <li>Using the same radius, describe a circle h from the center T.</li>
  <li>From the center O describe a circle i tangential to the circles e and h.</li>
  <li>From the center H, describe an arc k tangential to the circle i, and intersecting BF.</li>
  <li>Describe an arc l from the center G tangential to the circle h and intersecting FD.</li>
  <li>From the center G, describe an arc m tangential to the circle f and intersecting FD.</li>
  <li>Describe from the center H an arc n tangential to the circle f and intersecting BF.</li>
  <li>Draw the straight line HF, thereby establishing a point d on IQ.</li>
  <li>From the center Y, describe an arc a intersecting the point Q and the line dF.</li>
  <li>Using the same radius, describe from the center A an arc b intersecting GB and the circle h.</li>
  <li>Using the radius IK, describe a circle c tangential to the interiors of the arcs n and b.</li>
  <li>From the center d, describe a circle tangential to the arc a and to the arc m.</li>
</ul>
