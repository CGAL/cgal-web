Construct first a square ABCD, and bisect AC at E, BD at F, AB at G, and CD
at H. Draw the straight lines EF and GH, thereby establishing a point I at
their intersection. From the center I, describe a circle JIK on EF, the diameter
of which is one-ninth the distance AB. Using that same radius, describe
a circle LJI, thereby establishing a point N on the perimeter of the
circle I. Using that same radius, describe a circle IKM, thereby establishing
on the perimeter of the circle I a point O. Draw the straight line NO, and
produce it to intersect AG at P and HD at Q. From the pointI, construct a
line at right angles to PQ, thereby establishing on the perimeter of the
circle I the points T and S. Produce IT to intersect EC at Y. From the center
I, describe a circle Z tangential to AB, thereby establishing on PN a point
R. Using the radius IK, describe from the center R a circle VRU. Using that
same radius, decribe circles from the centers V and U. Bisect the intersections
of the circles V and R, thereby establishing a point W on VR. Bisect
the intersections of the circles R and U, thereby establishing a point X on
RU. From the center I, describe a circle e intersecting the point W. From
the center I, describe a circle f intersecting the point X. From the center S,
describe a circle g intersecting the point R. Using the same radius, describe
a circle h from the center T. From the center O describe a circle i tangential
to the circles e and h. From the center H, describe an arc k tangential to
the circle i, and intersecting BF. Describe an arc l from the center G
tangential to the circle h and intersecting FD. From the center G, describe an
arc m tangential to the circle f and intersecting FD. Describe from the
center H an arc n tangential to the circle f and intersecting BF. Draw the
straight line HF, thereby establishing a point d on IQ. From the center Y,
describe an arc a intersecting the point Q and the line dF. Using the same
radius, describe from the center A an arc b intersecting GB and the circle h.
Using the radius IK, describe a circle c tangential to the interiors of the
arcs n and b. From the center d, describe a circle tangential to the arc a
and to the arc m.
