</p>
<h3>Project description:</h3>
<p>
The Embree project has a low level API for ray shooting queries. First benchmarks show that Embree is faster than the CGAL AABB Tree. This is partially due to the use of vector operations.  The goal of this GSoC project is twofold. First, we want to allow to use Embree, for example in the mesh generator. Second the student should introduce vector operations in the AABB Tree.

<h3>Project description:</h3>
<p>
The goal of this project is to add some wrapper to allow CGAL to read/write different
classical input files.
</p><p>The obvious things we see that is missing are:
</p>
<ul><li> vtk data structures (unstructured grids, poly data, ...)
</li><li> MRI file formats for the meshing algorithms: Nifti (.nifti), Gis (.img, .hdr), vtk
</li><li> GIS file formats (WKT, GML, GeoJSON, ...)
</li></ul>
<p>The goal is not necessarily to re-implement these readers/writers but rely on existing software with a license compatible with CGAL

<h3>Project description:</h3>
<p>
The sphere can model atoms (biology) as well as the earth (geography) and the celestial vault (astrophysics), which shows a strong need for computations on the sphere. A method was proposed, a few years ago, to compute triangulations of points on or close to a sphere [1], and a prototype software has been written. The prototype is very efficient, but it duplicates some parts of the CGAL 2D triangulation classes. The project will consist in proposing a new design for those classes in order to avoid duplications, and implementing it. Some work is in progress in CGAL on re-designing the CGAL 3D triangulation packages, which will provide an example for a potential solution.

<h3>Project description:</h3>
<p>
Add the dynamic attributes functionality in the combinatorial maps package. The principle of this functionality is to allow users to add/remove attributes associated with cells of a combinatorial map dynamically. The idea is to use boost property maps, similarly to the existing code in the new Surface mesh package.

</p>
<h3>Project description:</h3>
<p>
CGAL currently provides a package for Axis Aligned Bounding Box trees in 3D. However, this package is not generic in the sense that it fixes the dimension and the type of the bounding volume. Moreover, the package does not provide intersection or distance computation of two Hierarchies. Based on a prototype implementation developed in Braunschweig the goal is to provide a new package that provides similar features while leaving the dimension and the bounding volume type unspecified.

<h3>Project description:</h3>
<p>
The upcoming CGAL package for visibility provides visibility computation within 2D polygons and in 1.5D Terrains. The goal of this project is to provide visibility computation in a
2.5D Terrain, that is, a 2D Triangulation where every vertex is annotated with a height value. A point ''p'' sees another point ''q'' iff the segment ''pq'' is nowhere below the given terrain. The goal is to compute the visible area for a given point ''p''.

The documentation of CGAL is generated using a patched version of doxygen.
In order to easily upgrade the version of doxygen used to generate the documentation, we need to check
that all the functions, classes and methods are correctly documented, and all elements are correctly linked.
</p>
<ul>
<li> The first goal of this project is to write a tool that can compare the html output directly or to add a new functionality in doxygen to help doing the comparison. </li>

</p>
<h3>Project description:</h3>
<p>
In several applications, it is necessary to compute exactly the intersection of a power diagram (a generalization of a Voronoi diagram) with a triangulation of the plane, e.g. implementation of Lloyd's algorithm for meshing, resolution of quadratic optimal transport problems in the plane, etc. The problem we consider is the following: our input is a set of weighted points (x_i,w_i) and a (completely unrelated) triangulation T of a domain of the plane. Denoting P_i the power cells of the ith point and t_j the jth triangles of the triangulation T, the goal is to compute the collection of non-empty intersections (P_i \cap t_j). The goals of the GSoC student are the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Implement an algorithm of [1] to perform this computation into CGAL. A preliminary implementation using CGAL [2] (but not included in CGAL yet) is available as a starting point, but there is room for improvement for the computation of the predicates and the API design.</li>
<li> Extend this implementation, so as to be able to compute the intersection of a 3D power diagram with an embedded 2D triangulation. This has application in surface remeshing.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<h3>Project description:</h3>
<p>
The goal of this project is to rewrite all the intersection predicates (<code>do_intersect_2/3</code>) to provide more information, but at the same time staying backward compatible. For example, say you want to know whether two segments intersect but also where lies the intersection, in the interior or at an endpoint of each segment. If the student is fast enough, an extension of the project is to rewrite intersection computation functions to take into account the result of the do-intersect predicate to speed up the computation.

<h3>Project description:</h3>
<p>
This project spans the bridge from statistical physics to CGAL. In
experiments on colloids, one challenge of our days is to measure, or
at least estimate thermodynamic properties such as pressure and
chemical potential (to finally get the free energy). There is one
special system, the hard-sphere liquid, where theoretical physics can
help to develop algorithms that allow to do that: The thermodynamics
of hard-sphere gases can indeed be measured from snapshots ("photos")
which contain only the positions and radii of the spheres. In the
algorithm, one needs an efficient and robust triangulation of space
that is adapted to the individual radii of the spheres. In order to
validate the algorithm, one wants to avoid the effect of boundaries.<br>
In summary, one needs precisely what is currently being developed in
CGAL: the periodic weighted Delaunay triangulation.
</p><p>
The project will comprise the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li> Extend an existing 2D prototype to 3D, using the CGAL periodic regular triangulation.
<li> Running the program on hard-sphere configurations that are
  generated by an existing molecular-dynamics code, to validate the
  thermodynamic properties.
</ul>
<p><b>Required Skills:</b> C++</p>
