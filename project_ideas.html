<h3 id="p1">Adding a Parallel Version of the Edge Simplification Algorithm</h3>
<p><b>Mentor(s):</b> Sebastien Loriot  (GeometryFactory) and Clément Jamin (INRIA)
</p><p><b>Project description:</b><br />
CGAL has a triangulated surface mesh edge simplification <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Surface_mesh_simplification/index.html">package</a>
based on the paper <i>Peter Lindstrom and Greg Turk. Fast and memory efficient polygonal simplification. In IEEE Visualization, pages 279–286, 1998.</i>
The goal of this project is to use a modified version of this algorithm to allow edges of a mesh to be simplified using parallel threads.

<h3 id="p2">Reworking Intersection Functions</h3>
<p><b>Mentor(s):</b> Sebastien Loriot
</p><p><b>Project description:</b><br />
The goal of this project is to rewrite all the intersection predicates (<code>do_intersect_2/3</code>) to provide more information, but at the same time staying backward compatible. For example, say you want to know whether two segments intersect but also where lies the intersection, in the interior or at an endpoint of each segment. If the student is fast enough, an extension of the project is to rewrite intersection computation functions to take into account the result of the do-intersect predicate to speed up the computation.

<h3 id="p7">Create a Bridge Between the Available Github "webhooks", and the Usual Git Hook Scripts</h3>
<p><b>Mentor(s):</b> Laurent Rineau
</p><p><b>Project description:</b><br />
The CGAL project has moved from a dedicated Git repository to the Github service. One issue is that Github no-longer support the server Git hooks, but only its own instance named "webhook". The student will implement a bridge between Github webhooks and usual Git hook scripts, so that one can for example use <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://github.com/mhagger/git-multimail">git-multimail</a> with Github.

<h3 id="p8">Finalizing a Package for 2D Triangulations on the Sphere</h3>
<p><b>Mentor(s):</b> Sébastien Loriot (GeometryFactory) and Monique Teillaud (INRIA)
</p><p><b>Project description:</b><br />
The sphere can model atoms (biology) as well as the earth (geography) and the celestial vault (astrophysics), which shows a strong need for computations on the sphere. A method was proposed, a few years ago, to compute triangulations of points on or close to a sphere [1], and a prototype software has been written. The prototype is very efficient, but it duplicates some parts of the CGAL 2D triangulation classes. The project will consist in proposing a new design for those classes in order to avoid duplications, and implementing it.

<h3 id="p10">Sparse Eigenvalue Solver and Application to Diffusion Distances</h3>
<p><b>Mentor(s):</b> Pierre Alliez (Inria) and Jane Tournois (GeometryFactory)
</p><p><b>Project description:</b><br /> The eigen-structure of linear operators is relevant for a number of geometry processing algorithms on meshes such as pose-invariant shape signatures for shape retrieval, spectral embedding, parameterization of surface meshes, clustering, correspondence, diffusion distances and surface reconstruction. Popular operators include Laplace Beltrami (1st order and higher order) and distance matrices, the most frequent ones being defined as symmetric positive definite operators. 
In general we need to calculate a specific number of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a large sparse square matrix A (smallest or largest), smaller than the size of A. 
</p><p>Recent advances on solvers through the Eigen and ARPACK-Eigen [1] C++ libraries makes it possible to add an eigenvalue solver in CGAL with little dependency, as both libraries are header-only. In addition, in ARPACK-Eigen the user only requires to define operations on matrix A such as a matrix-vector product. The library is particularly powerful when the matrix-vector product can be computed efficiently, which is the case when A is sparse.
</p><p>The objective of this project is to implement a generic design for computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of linear operators on surface meshes and point sets sampled on surfaces. We will first experiment with the Laplace-Beltrami operator to compute diffusion distance [2]. The heat diffusion kernel, derived from the spectral decomposition of M, provides a means to compute approximate geodesic distances at low computational cost. Such approximation can be leveraged in a wide range of potential applications.

<h3 id="p11">Improving the Point Set Shape Detection Component</h3>
<p><b>Mentors:</b> Simon Giraudot (GeometryFactory), Pierre Alliez (Inria) and Laurent Busé (Inria)
</p><p><b>Project description:</b><br /> The Shape Detection component implements an efficient RANSAC-based primitive shape detection algorithm for point sets with unoriented normals. Five types of primitive shapes are detected: plane, sphere, cylinder, cone and torus. 
</p><p>This component can be improved in three ways:
</p><p>1. Connectivity constraint. To avoid generating shapes with fragmented support we enforce a connectivity constraint by considering only one connected component, referred to as cluster, selected as the one covering the largest number of inliers. While this constraint is efficiently met for developable shapes such as planes or cylinders, it renders the algorithm slow for non-developables shapes such as cones and torii. The objective is to devise a novel data structure and efficient algorithm to enumerate the connected components for cones and torii. This requires devising a parameterization method for these primitives, and dealing with degenerate cases.
</p><p>2. Random shape generators. The current shape detection algorithm relies upon random generation of primitive shapes, given a small set of points and unoriented normals. Recent findings show that such generator can be made more efficient by requiring less contraints.
</p><p>3. Other shape types. Other types can be detected through implementing a class deriving from the base shape class. The goal is to demonstrate such genericity by defining composed primitives such as a crease edge formed by two orthogonal planes, a corner formed by three mutually orthogonal planes, and 3D boxes.

<h3 id="p12">Robust Normal estimation for Point Clouds with Sharp Features</h3>
<p><b>Mentors:</b> Simon Giraudot (GeometryFactory), Alexandre Boulch (Onera) 
</p><p><b>Project description:</b><br /> Boulch and Marlet devised an algorithm for estimating normals on unorganized point clouds that preserves sharp features [1]. This approach offers an excellent tradeoff between precision, speed, and robustness. In addition, the authors have implemented a prototype algorithm based on CGAL. Starting from this prototype, the goal is to convert it into an algorithm for the point set processing component of CGAL, with examples, tests and plugin for the polyhedron demo of CGAL.

<h3 id="p13">Implementing a Package for Computation of Surface Maps.</h3>
<p><b>Mentors:</b> Yaron Lipman(Weizmann Institute of Science), Andreas Fabri (GeometryFactory)</p>
<p><b>Project description:</b><br />
Computing high quality mappings between surfaces is a core task in computer graphics, computer vision, medical imaging and related fields. This projects aims at implementing algorithms ([1],[2]) for computing bijective, low distortion mappings between surface-meshes. The implementation will consist of a couple of algorithms which follow the same  three steps: i) cutting the meshes into disk topology; ii) embedding the meshes into a canonical domain and reducing the distortion of the embedding via optimization; iii) computing the surface map induced from the embeddings via an overlay procedure and/or lifting.
